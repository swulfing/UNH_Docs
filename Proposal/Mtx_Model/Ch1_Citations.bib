Previous modelling approaches have focused primarily on local and/or global scales, while regional scale models have been relatively few. In this study, regional scale predictive habitat models are presented for deep-sea corals for the U.S. West Coast (California, Oregon and Washington). Model results are intended to aid in future research or mapping efforts and to assess potential coral habitat suitability both within and outside existing bottom trawl closures (i.e. Essential Fish Habitat (EFH)) and identify suitable habitat within U.S. National Marine Sanctuaries (NMS). Deep-sea coral habitat suitability was modelled at 500 m6500 m spatial resolution using a range of physical, chemical and environmental variables known or thought to influence the distribution of deep-sea corals. Using a spatial partitioning cross-validation approach, maximum entropy models identified slope, temperature, salinity and depth as important predictors for most deep-sea coral taxa. Large areas of highly suitable deep-sea coral habitat were predicted both within and outside of existing bottom trawl closures and NMS boundaries. Predicted habitat suitability over regional scales are not currently able to identify coral areas with pin point accuracy and probably overpredict actual coral distribution due to model limitations and unincorporated variables (i.e. data on distribution of hard substrate) that are known to limit their distribution. Predicted habitat results should be used in conjunction with multibeam bathymetry, geological mapping and other tools to guide future research efforts to areas with the highest probability of harboring deep-sea corals. Field validation of predicted habitat is needed to quantify model accuracy, particularly in areas that have not been sampled.},

	abstract = {The enhancement of salmon populations has long been used to increase the abundance of salmon returning to spawn and/ or to be captured in fisheries. However, in some instances enhancement can have adverse impacts on adjacent nonenhanced populations. In Canada’s Skeena watershed, smolt-to-adult survival of Babine Lake sockeye from 1962–2002 was inversely related to the abundance of sockeye smolts leaving Babine Lake. This relationship has led to the concern that Babine Lake smolt production, which is primarily enhanced by spawning channels, may depress wild Skeena (Babine and non-Babine) sockeye populations as a result of increased competition between wild and enhanced sockeye smolts as they leave their natal lakes and co-migrate to sea. To test this hypothesis we used data on Skeena sockeye populations and oceanographic conditions to statistically examine the relationship between Skeena sockeye productivity (adult salmon produced per spawner) and an index of Babine Lake enhanced smolt abundance while accounting for the potential influence of early marine conditions. While we had relatively high power to detect large effects, we did not find support for the hypothesis that the productivity of wild Skeena sockeye is inversely related to the abundance of enhanced sockeye smolts leaving Babine Lake in a given year. Importantly, life-time productivity of Skeena sockeye is only partially explained by marine survival, and likely is an unreliable measure of the influence of smolt abundance. Limitations to our analyses, which include: (1) the reliance upon adult salmon produced per spawner (rather than per smolt) as an index of marine survival, and (2) incomplete age structure for most of the populations considered, highlight uncertainties that should be addressed if understanding relationships between wild and enhanced sockeye is a priority in the Skeena.},

Coral reefs have historically been introduced to various stressors from hurricanes to climate change to food web disturbances. Some basic aspects of this food web are zooxanthellae algae which have a symbiotic relationship with coral, as they live within the coral tissue and receive nutrients while providing organic compounds during the photosynthetic process. The coral also has a mutualistic relationship with sea urchins as they graze on algal turf yet sea urchins are in a state of decline due to various environmental pressures, making way for parrotfish to rise as the primary grazers of algal turf. Macroalgae is known to prevent reef growth as they colonize growth sites for new polyps. This paper aims to model this complex relationship combined with social factors such as fishing intensity. The human aspect is modeled by concepts from game theory, where human opinion or strategies actively change based on the current condition of the environment.
 
To do this, Thampi et al. build on a previous paper’s models (Blackwood et al.) except they add a public opinion component, which influences the population of parrotfish (i.e. fishing intensity and governmental regulation).
 
In their results, they found they could reach an undesirable stable state with a parrotfish growth rate of zero. This results in high microalgal cover (and no coral) as well has high public opinion, which is not sufficient to recover parrotfish levels as the population is not viable. We can get the model to stabilize under a “Macroalgae Free Equilibrium” (MFE), where the parrotfish growth rate outweighs the exploitation rate. It is also possible to model oscillatory behavior over long periods of time, where exploitation increases and declines the coral population which causes a shift in public opinion and reduces fishing intensity.
 
This is the first paper to model coupled socio-ecological dynamics in coral systems. Social pressure can be a key part in promoting conservatism, but only if it is an initially dominant opinion. They also found that the system tended to oscillate between boom and bust cycles, with a few exceptions with specific parameters. Further, under certain parameters, high maximum fishing rates could be counteracted with conservation efforts but these were very specific scenarios.
 
The model does simply the grazer-algal relationship as more species of algae and grazers exist and have more complex life histories and fishing rates, some of these systems have been observed and have higher rates of recovery. They further discuss that there is a lack of data regarding how social norms and sensitivity to coral cover affect attitudes toward conservation. Climate change is also not accounted for in the model.},

	annote = {Allee effects are defined as positive density dependence where an increase in population size leads to an increase in per capita growth rate. This paper models Allee effects in populations of the Eastern oyster. They provide many benefits to their surrounding environment while simultaneously experiencing population declines due to overfishing, coastal development, disease, and pollution. Positive feedback relationships exist between living oysters and shell substrate. Oyster shells provide solid substrate on which new larvae can attach and grow, thereby creating a reef which provides shelter from predators and preventing burial in sediment. These feedbacks can actually change the Allee threshold for population growth vs. decline and create alternative stable states. Restoration efforts can also alter this threshold and come in the form of stock enhancement, habitat enhancement, and a combination of the two.
 
This paper uses an integral projection model (IPM) to explore three questions: the properties of the Allee threshold and introduce an analytic method for approximating it, the effect of population size structure on the threshold surface, and the relative effectiveness of the two restoration actions. 
 
The resulting model had a hard time assessing growth and survival functions due to data shortages so they used only a size function and then included a maximum age of survival. The proportion of females in the population increased as a function of size. The model found a large region between the two threshold slices where populations beginning at the equilibrium size distribution will increase to infinity, but populations beginning at the harvested size distribution will decline to extinction, even if the population begins above. Additionally, populations beginning at the harvested size distribution will often exhibit complex, oscillatory behavior during the first 10-12 years of the simulation, regardless of whether they are declining toward extinction or increasing toward infinity. Further, adding oysters between the ages of 3-7 were found to have the highest retention rate when it came to conservation efforts (mid-age oysters). Restoration of existing populations depended strongly upon the initial size distribution of the population. One limitation of the model is that it considered these populations “closed” in that there was assumed to be no breeding between sites. The paper argues that more research into the rates of external recruitment could better refine the model.},

We found a total of 51 reports of documented changes in Arctic marine biota in response to climate change. Among the responses evaluated were range shifts and changes in abundance, growth/condition, behaviour/phenology and community/regime shifts. Most reports concerned marine mammals, particularly polar bears, and ﬁsh. The number of well-documented changes in planktonic and benthic systems was surprisingly low. Evident losses of endemic species in the Arctic Ocean, and in ice algae production and associated community remained difﬁcult to evaluate due to the lack of quantitative reports of its abundance and distribution. Very few footprints of climate change were reported in the literature from regions such as the wide Siberian shelf and the central Arctic Ocean due to the limited research effort made in these ecosystems. Despite the alarming nature of warming and its strong potential effects in the Arctic Ocean the research effort evaluating the impacts of climate change in this region is rather limited.},

Developing theoretical models of coupled human-environment systems is a continuing area of research, although relatively few of these models are based on diﬀerential equations. Here we develop a simple diﬀerential equation coupled human-environment system model of coupled forest growth dynamics and conservationist opinion dynamics in a human population. The model assumes logistic growth and harvesting in the forest. Opinion spread in the human population is based the interplay between conservation values stimulated by forest rarity, and injunctive social norms that tend to support population conformity. We ﬁnd that injunctive social norms drive the system to the boundaries of phase space, whereas rarity-based conservation priorities drive the system to the interior. The result is complex dynamics including limit cycles and alternative stable states that do not occur if injunctive social norms are absent. We also ﬁnd that increasing the inherent perceived value of forests is the best way to boost and stabilize forest cover while also boosting conservationist opinion in the population. We conclude that simple models can provide insights and suggest patterns that might be harder to see with complicated, high-dimensional models, and therefore should be pursued more often in research on coupled human-environment systems.},

Two steady states of full conservation. No forest cover (0,1) and full (1,1)

Mix of forest and other land cover (1+hS, 1+RS). biologically meaningful if 0{\textgreater}RS{\textgreater}-1 (same with hS)

Changing the initial value for forest cover doesnt have a huge effect over long periods of time. Is it the same for coral?
Paper then models without social norms.
Two steady states  of no conservationism (F, x)

B = (0,0) No foest cover
B = (1-h/r, 0) When succession rated dominates harvesting rate. Low harvesting = high forest cover

Two steady states for full conservationism

B = (0,1) No forest cover
B = (1,1) Full forest cover

B steady states are the same as the A steady states (those with injunctive social norms)!!!
Reducing equation A6 to no injunctive social norms ={\textgreater}
B5 = (c, 1-R/h(1-c)) meaningful with ratio of harvesting rate to the succession rate dominates relative conservation value or h/R {\textgreater}1-c. Larger conservation valuus result in higher forest cover and conservationism prevalence.
B = (0,0) is unstable. Different from A, which can be stable for some parameter values. Same for B = (0,1) and B = (1,1)
B5 is LAS if ratio of harvesting rate no natural succession rate is greater than the relative value of other land uses.
Social learning can have good and bad impacts. high learning {\textless}- high recovery but also high destruction
High succession rate can overcome absence of public support
Discussion:
Injunctive social norms drive dynamics to the boundaries of the phase space, while rarity-based conservation drives it back to the interior

Based on biological records, the secondary spread of the European green crab Carcinus maenas has maintained a relatively consistent rate of advance for over 100 yr, covering a wide range of temperate latitudes and local hydrological environments along the Atlantic coast of North America. We employed a discrete-time model to investigate the green crab’s spreading speed and the relationship between demography and dispersal. The model is an age-structured integro-difference equation that couples a matrix for population growth and a dispersal kernel for spread of individuals within a season. The choice of a Normal or Laplace distribution for the dispersal kernel has only a minimal effect on the spreading speed. Our modeling exercise illustrates that there are many realistic combinations of vital rates (fecundity and survival) and dispersal rates that give rise to a given spreading speed c*. Further, our results indicate that the invasion speed is most sensitive to the standard deviation of larval dispersal, followed by recruitment rate (a demographic parameter that combines fecundity, larval survival, and juvenile survival), and least sensitive to adult survival. We thus enhance understanding of invasion biology, specifically the relative importance of demography versus dispersal distance for marine species with a pelagic larval stage.

Invasions happen in 3 steps:

Arrival
establishment of viable population in new place
spread into surrounding areas

Demography split into 1st year juveniles, 2nd year, adult females
Splits northern and southern linneages of green crabs into two separate dispersal rates
Used empirical data to calculate dispersal speeds. Coastline was defined as a straight line between two bays. There's a strong current between them.
Results:
Used observational data to analyze suspected first appearance points
For northern population, spreading speed C is increasing in both r and sigma, but decreasing in mu. Spreading speed can also be achieved with feasible values of r and sigma (with one being low and the other high) i.e. decreasing curve in the r - sigma plane giving rise to constant spread rate
At low sigma: small sigma decrease requires large r increase to obtain same speed
At high sigma: small decrease in sigma requires small increase in r
C* is less sensitive to recruitment rate r when both r and adult survival Ba are low
Conclusions about C*

the importance of recruitment rate on c* is dependent on the values of the recruitment rate
the net displacement downstream, μ, has a negative impact on c
the elasticity of c* to r bincreases as r decreases

c* is most sensitive to dispersal parameter sigma than demographic parameters
Assumptions:

1 dimensional coastline- adding more may add flow dynamics but crabs tent to settle, grow, and reproduce along coastlines
Spatial homogeneity
simple shifted kernal for larval dispersal for juvenile andd adult
Demographic processes are assumed to be linearly dependent on pop density: no allee effects and no carrying capacity
Vital rates assumed to be independent of location

Article discusses 3-5 in detail
Implications for further research and management:
Anthropogenic activities that facilitate spread already acknowledged
Standard dev of larval dispersal rather than vital rates (fecundity, survival probabilities), has the most effect on spreading speed. But isn't manageable by humans
Fecundity and survival rates: targeting juveniles is the most realistic in practice. Adult survival least affected dynamics but modern fishing practices only target adults. Although other factors more effective, coupling targeting green adults and juveniles is most effective
Normal vs Laplace didn't affect much
Mean displacement downstream only really effects spread
Future field research requirements:

better understanding of factors affecting the survival ofjuvenile green crabs
testing model predictions in the field

Future model research:

assessing the effect of different types of dispersal kernels beyond the symmetric, exponentially-bounded Normal and Laplace distributions
evaluating the effect of patchy habitats on the crab’s spreading speed and the possibility of adult movement contributing to dispersal rates.

Further study of larval processes using hydrographic modeling, population models, and field investigations would improve model quality},

	abstract = {A signiﬁcant global challenge lies in our current inability to anticipate, and therefore prepare for, critical ecological thresholds (i.e. tipping points in ecosystems). This deﬁcit stems largely from an inadequate understanding of the many complex interactions between species and the environment at the ecosystem level, and the paucity of mechanistic models relating environment to population dynamics at the species level. In marine ecosystems, abundant, short-lived and fast-growing species such as anchovies or squids, consistently function as ‘keystone’ groups whose population dynamics affect entire ecosystems. Increasing exploitation coupled with climate change impacts has the potential to affect these ecological groups and consequently, the entire marine ecosystem. There are currently very few models that predict the impact of climate change on these keystone groups. Here we use a combination of individual-based bioenergetics and stage-structured population models to characterize the fundamental capacity of cephalopods to respond to climate change. We demonstrate the potential for, and mechanisms behind, two unfavourable climate-change-induced thresholds in future population dynamics. Although one threshold was the direct consequence of a decrease in incubation time caused by ocean warming, the other threshold was linked to survivorship, implying the possibility of management through a modiﬁcation of ﬁshing mortality. Additional substantive changes in phenology were also predicted, with a possible loss in population resilience. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting complex nonlinear dynamics with a reasonably simplistic mechanistic model, and highlight the necessity of developing such approaches for other species if attempts to moderate the impact of climate change on natural resources are to be effective.},

Predicting thresholds difficult bc inadequate understanding of the many nonlinear, cross-scale interactions at the ecosystem level. Progress in this area is impeded by the limited number of mechanistic models relating environment to population dynamics at the species level.
Cephalopods: keystone species with short lifespan and high environment sensibility. Changes can cause:

Changes in cephalopod abundance have a potential mixed impact on marine communities and fisheries
Changes in their predators and prey population abundance
Predator breeding success

Model: Matrix population parameterised with outputs from a temperature-dependant individual-based bioenergetic model
    Simulates the seasonal population dynamics and population     structure of an exploited octopus population
Looked at two scenarios:

Based on seawater temp predicted on highest emission scenario
No climate change scenario (based on 2005 data)

Only considered female octopus: only drivers of pop dynamics and male octopus present all year round
Stage based model: See caswell 2001
What's a bioenegetics model? Used to estimate parameters of mtx pop models when data too expensive or complicated. See Liao et al. 2006, Neer at al. 2007, Andre et. al 2009

allowed the inclusion of the effects of individual variability (in hatchling size, growth rate and size at maturity) and environment on the vital rates of octopus

Model description in notes.
Used a bioenergetics model to determine post hatchling transition probabilities. In this study, its basis was the Dynamic Temperature-dependent Energy Balance Model.

Determined trajectories of juvenile eggs hatched in different seasons based on food availability, metabolism, environmental temp, and individual variability (hatchling size, inherent growth capacity)
parameterized through lab and field data and then validated against size at age data

This study extends DTEBM to include mature stages to permit prediction of growth of individual females within cohorts

warming temp scenario-simulations run for individuals hatched in 2005, 2030, 2050, and 2070
no warming temp scenario

Included individual variability at hatchling size, body mass at maturity, and inherent growth capacity
two temp functions:

High emission scenario (see notes) Gives max temp of 17.32 C in 2005 and 19.42 C in 2070 (2.11 C increase)

Hatchlings split into four stages, depending on hatch season (Also explained in Andre et al. 2009)
Narrowing of each seasonal hatchling size distribution and a decrease in mean hatchling size were predicted with time under the climate-change scenario (years 2005, 2030, 2050, and 2070). Hatchling size was described by a lognormal distribution A{\textasciitilde}L(µ,σ) where µ = ln(m) and m is the median of the distribution. 
Inherent growth rate and sexual mat- Bmat and Mopt treated as covariates and selected from bivariate normal dist. under the assumptions:

Bmat was temperature dependent, based on the general observation that high temperatures lead to reproduction at small sizes
The relationship between temperature (T) and the meanmBmat of the Bmat distribution was negatively linear. Based on a difference of 10 g in mean body mass at maturity between 2005 (mean Bmat 5 466 g) and 2006 (mean Bmat 5 456 g) samples and a difference in mean annual temperature T0 of 0.3 1C between 2 years, the change in mBmat was estimated at 33.3 g per 1 1C increase in temperature. Assuming, from the temperature projection, a yearly increase in mean annual water temperature of 0.0324 1C over the next 65 years, the value of mBmat as a function of time can be expressed asmBmat(year) = -1.07892 year + 2629.235
The variance of the Bmat distribution was assumed constant.
mopt was by nature temperature independent and ranged from 0.0217 and 0.0967 SEE Andre et al. 2009
Individuals with higher mopt reached sexual maturity at a smaller body mass.

Assumed that egg laying occurred within week of individuals reaching sexual mat. Body mass at egg deposition was therefore calculated by extending the growth trajectory (exponential or linear) that individuals were following at the time of sexual maturity for a further 7 days. In cases where the switch in growth phase occurred during these 7 days, the growth trajectory was changed to reflect the slowing growth rate
Simulations:

Years 2005, 2030, 2050, 2070
One hundred micro-cohorts were generated by season, each containing 400 females
Mortality not included
individual growth trajectories within seasonal micro-cohorts were projected until individuals reached egg laying
Hatchling size (A) was selected randomly from hatchling size distribution
inherent growth capacity (mopt) and body weight at sexual maturity (Bmat) were selected randomly from the corresponding bivariate normal distribution.

264 projection matrices used for climate change scenario (4 seasonal per yr btwn 2005 and 2070) while only 4 used for the no climate change scenario. Transition btwn posthatch stages-bioenergetics model. Transition btwn egg and hatchling from relationship btwn environmental temp and incubation time.
Fecundities from leporati et al
Important assumption: fisheries catch levels match 2005/2006 levels
Results:
Trajectories ranted from extinction to exponential growth depending on maximum survivorship. Could also have balance between the two, which resulted in the ID of two thresholds, splitting three phases

Exponential growth phase
exponential decline phase
end phase

Increased survival delayed onset of first threshold and increased seasonal fluctuations in end phase
Second threshold seemed independent of survivorship and always occurred at same time
despite expanding populations, increasing mortality would only accelerate the crossing of the first threshold towards an exponential population decline, with repercussions for the rest of the ecosystem.

	abstract = {Carbonate hardparts of marine organisms are frequently explored archives of their ambient seawater composi­ tion. Among the various materials used, the hardparts of molluscs are particularly relevant because their accretionary growth allows for the compilation of time-resolved proxy data sets. Here, we explore to which extent the calcium isotope values of aragonitic cephalopod hardparts represent proxies for seawater composition or record a trophic level signal. In a first step, we collect Ca isotope data from a diverse set of modern cepha­ lopods, including Nautilus, Sepia and Spirula. These taxa differ in their external/internal hardparts, life spans, trophic levels, habitat depth, hinterland geology, and resulting runoff. In a second step, we have put these concepts to the test and explore the calcium isotope signatures of Lower Cretaceous (lower Albian) wellpreserved cephalopods (nautiloids, ammonoids and belemnites) and bivalve shells from Madagascar. In the sense of a methodological comparison, two measurement approaches (double spike (δ44/40Ca, TIMS) and bracketing standard (δ44/42Ca, MC-ICP-MS) techniques are applied. Calcium from organic matter and intra-shell variations on bulk δ44/40Ca isotope values are explored. Four protocols (H2O2, NaOH, HClO4, incineration up to 250 ◦C including subsequent rinsing with deionised water and Ca removal) are applied to destroy organic matter in the shell material and to dissolve any non‑carbonate bound Ca, i.e., its metastable secondary Ca reservoir. These are equally successful, and the Ca isotope values of the purified carbonate phase plot on the equilibrium mass fractionation line. Samples not treated to destroy or remove their organic matter do not fall on the equi­ librium mass fractionation line. Limitations of sample pre-treatment are reflected by a slight shift towards lower values in the case of incineration experiments at 650 ◦C. This feature is best explained in the context of a mineralogical phase transformation of aragonite to calcite. Calcium isotope values show no significant variability when sampling hardparts with different microstructures (callus, nacre, prismatic layer) and mineralised during different ontogenetic phases (outer shell, septa). Perhaps most relevant, mean δ44/40Ca (‰ SRM-915a) isotope values for Nautilus (0.72‰ ±0.19 2SD), Sepia (0.79‰ ±0.18 2SD), and Spirula (0.50‰ ±0.18 2SD) lack evidence for a significant control by trophic levels. Nitrogen isotope data and known diets for all three cephalopods serve as a litmus test for these data, which do not correlate with this dietary proxy information. These results are considered encouraging and suggest that Ca isotope values of cephalopod shells are proxies for their ambient seawater Ca isotope signatures. According to our data, however, it remains unclear to which extend cephalopod hardparts record the Ca isotopic composition of past seawater. Specifically, the data from three different modern species point to a mean Δ44/40Ca(ceph-seawater) fractionation of − 1.21‰ (± 0.15 2SD). Based on our work, we present a best practice guide for cephalopod Ca isotope analysis and interpretation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The population density of Octopus vulgaris was measured by visual census with scuba diving in coastal areas in Greece (eastern Mediterranean). A time-variant, stage-classified, matrix population model was developed to interpret the seasonal variation of octopus stage densities and to estimate several life cycle parameters. An annual and a semi-annual periodic cycle were found in the stage densities. A main peak of benthic settlement was observed during summer and a secondary, irregular one during late autumn. Two spawning peaks were estimated, a main one during late winter–spring and a secondary one during late summer–early autumn. More than 50\% of the just-settled individuals will eventually die after 3 months. Mortality rate declines, as individuals grow larger, reaches a minimum approximately 6 months after settlement, and then grows again probably because of terminal spawning. The life expectancy of recently settled individuals ({\textless}50 g) during their summer peak is approximately 5 months. The lifespan of the common octopus is estimated to be between 12 and 15 months. The octopuses' mean specific growth rates (±s.d.) in their natural environment were 1.61 ± 0.30 d−1 for 50–200 g individuals and 1.19 ± 0.31 d−1 for 200–500 g individuals.},

However, very little is known i.e. no paralarval density study has been conducted (define paralarval as part of life history convo) (confirm this, its from a 2006 study) (Katsanevakis and verriopoulos 2006) However, squid and cuttlefish known to have extremely high dispersals FIND CITATION PRINTOUT
Often have two population peaks corresponding with two peaks for juveniles (Katsanevakis and verriopoulos 2006) Applying this to Madagascar fisheries (Less temporal variation than Mediterranean) Could be key moments for conservation
Research of Decapodiformes (Squids and cuttlefish) have often been inconclusive and conflicting in determining phylogenetic relations, esp when using multiple analyses (morphology, transcriptome, mitochondrial genomes)(Anderson, Lindgren 2021 This paper has more citations on this, put them here if u want)

This could also give you good info on specific species morphology, depending on what species are in Madagascar

Short term MPA’s resulted in rapid bounceback of Octopus (size and number) reemergence due to high spawning rates and short life cycle (Benbow 2014, Katsanevakis 2006, Humber 2006). But also rapid decline once fishing resumed (also result of higher fishing effort in the area following a reopening). Sensitive to protection levels Humber 2006

Conversation about how and why visual census is better than catch/release data for stage based matrices(Katsanevakis verriopoulos 2006, see other citation in their paper).

	abstract = {Diet composition of nine commercially exploited fishery resources which contributes 55–60\% of the total fish landings in the northwest coast of India were analyzed in this study. Gut content analysis of the selected fish groups has shown significant variations in the prey composition and predator preference on a prey item. The diet matrix revealed Acetes sp. (32.74\%) as a key and common shared prey item, followed by mesopelagic fishes (30.51\%), other shrimps (11.00\%), digested material (7.42\%), crabs (4.03\%) and cephalopods (2.77\%), etc. In this study, Acetes sp was considered as a proxy for the non-penaeid prawns due to its significant contribution (92\%) to the total non-penaeid landings. Targeted exploitation of Acetes sp. has intensified recently (from 0.44 lakh t in 2004 to 1.40 lakh t in 2018) with an average annual growth rate of 11.2\% due to the demand from fish meal plants. By considering its ecological and fishery importance, Acetes sp. should be considered as keystone species in the ecosystem. The Schaefer surplus production model was used to calculate the Biological Reference Points (BRPs) and model parameters MSY, FMSY, r, EMSY, and K. The model fit was fair (R2 = 0.630) and significantly positive correlation was observed between CPUEobserved and CPUEmodel. The estimated optimum exploitation limits (p {\textless} 0.05) for the fishery were Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) as 1.20 lakh t and fishing effort required to harvest MSY (EMSY) as 51.30 lakh fishing hours. However, the recent exploitation yield and fishing effort are beyond the optimum exploitation limits. Further increase in exploitation of the resources may hamper the sustainability of the stocks and may lead to detrimental impact on the trophic interactions of the fishery resources. Technical interventions are needed in the field of post-harvest and value addition for attaining fair economic returns from the harvest which at present forms a low-value high-volume fishery. Sustainable exploitation and management measures need to be introduced and implemented for the Acetes sp. in order to sustain the stocks and to maintain the integrity of the fishery ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships among the squids and cuttlefishes (Cephalopoda:Decapodiformes) have resisted clarification for decades, despite multiple analyses of morphological, molecular and combined data sets. More recently, analyses of complete mitochondrial genomes and hundreds of nuclear loci have yielded similarly ambiguous results. In this study, we re-evaluate hypotheses of decapodiform relationships by increasing taxo­ nomic breadth and utilizing higher-quality genome and transcriptome data for several taxa. We also employ analytical approaches to (1) identify contamination in transcriptome data, (2) better assess model adequacy, and (3) account for potential biases. Using this larger data set, we consistently recover a clade comprising Myopsida (closed-eye squid), Sepiida (cuttlefishes), and Oegopsida (open-eye squid) that is sister to a Sepiolida (bobtail and bottletail squid) clade. Idiosepiida (pygmy squid) is consistently recovered as the sister group to all sampled decapodiform lineages. Further, a weighted Shimodaira-Hasegawa test applied to one of our larger data matrices rejects all alternatives to these ordinal-level relationships. At present, available nuclear genome-scale data support nested clades of relatively large-bodied decapodiform cephalopods to the exclusion of pygmy squids, but improved taxon sampling and additional genomic data will be needed to test these novel hypotheses rigorously.},

“In other words, like Vezo-ness itself, the signs that Vezo identity leaves on the body are performative-a body becomes recognizable as a Vezo body only through its activities in the present.” Astuti 1995
Vezo canoes last at most two years; they are light, flexible, and fragile; they are built by only a few people at a time and sail no more than two; even the most successful catch can be no larger than what the canoe's narrow hull can carry back to shore. The canoe's physical structure reflects and incorporates all the characteristics of the livelihood of the Vezo: flimsy, short-lived, and small-scale. Astuti 1995

When effective, LMMAs can encourage responsible fishing, strengthen compliance and improve adaptive capacity, and may help to safeguard food security, address coastal poverty and increase resource sustainability. However, evidence that LMMAs can achieve long-term biological goals is limited. Here, we used a six-year dataset and a before-after-control-impact sampling design to assess the bio­ logical effectiveness of five community-managed no take zones (CMNTZs) situated within the Velondriake LMMA in southwest Madagascar. Linear mixed-effect models revealed that the difference in biomass between control and reserve sites increased over time. Significant differences in biomass between CMNTZs and controls were only evident from year two onwards, with 189\% more total biomass in CMNTZs than fished control sites by year six. There was no effect of CMNTZs on the biomass of fish families preferentially targeted by the local fishery, limiting the long-term fisheries benefits of this reserve network unless individual CMNTZs are made larger to accommodate the home ranges of fishery targeted families. There were however, reserve effects preventing the decline of untargeted fish families and species richness.},

Despite discursive and institutional shifts toward more “collaborative” and “community-based” conservation programing, there is a deficiency of women’s nominal as well as effective participation in community management organizations. This research shows that conservation organizations’ focus on proximate drivers of marine resource use, or a politics of picking the “low-hanging fruit,” over ultimate drivers such as global commodity chains, places disproportionate emphasis on marine spatial enclosures and restricting specific, and gendered, harvest methods. To address gender bias concerning access to and control over natural resources, we must go beyond the rhetoric of “community involvement” to address gendered inequalities in conservation decision making, and whose interests are served by conservation projects.},

Differences in fishing methods: Men boat out to fish and women fish on land at low tides-both a difference in catch method AND provides gendered aspect to fishing methods Medard 2017. In Kobalava and Hoalankara, MPA’s restrict women’s access to fishing. In Kobalava this is because the shoreline is now and MPA. In Hoalankara this is because of restrictions. Women if they fish, do so in secret at night. Tsimalaho MPA has a more indirect effect, as the organizations have found land-based livelihoods for fisherwomen (such as basket weaving and handicraft production training), while simultaneously focusing on ways in which to enhance fishermen’s marine-based livelihood (such as fiberglass boat building training to allow fishermen to venture into deeper waters further offshore). Medard 2017
Regendering - a post modern paradox Medard 2017. Two ways:

The selection of conservation project community collaborators, a process that deepened and broadened a form of male leadership that was previously confined to particular contexts
the spatial scaling down of environmental problem identification. This spatial narrowing legitimized conservation efforts focused on local behavior change and spatial enclosures targeting small-scale fisheries, ultimately diverting attention away from very important and more distant drivers of fisheries collapse and ecological decline.


In Madagascar, recent reports show declining catch across multiple fisheries (Le Manach et al. 2012). Although laws exist in Madagascar that ban certain types of fishing gear, restrict certain fisheries seasonally, and prohibit the extraction of endangered marine organisms, the seeming ineffectiveness of these management strategies, along with pressure from the international policy arena to put 10\% of all marine and coastal environments under protection,4 has resulted in a precipitous expansion of MPAs in Madagascar (Cinner et al. 2009; Harris 2011; Corson and MacDonald 2012; Oliver et al. 2015). Shortly after the 2003 World Parks Congress where the former president of Madagascar pledged to dramatically increase the total area under protection in Madagascar (Corson 2011), including 1 million marine hectares (Commission SAPM 2009; Allnutt et al. 2012), the number of MPAs exponentially increased and now both governmental and nongovernmental organizations fund and implement MPAs in every region of the island. Medard 2017
Women fish less frequently than men Medard 2017
In one region surveyed in Madagascar, more than 75\% of all fish caught were sold for export. Focusing on local drivers of resource degradation, such as women’s fishing practice of walking on reefs, thus masks larger economic and political processes that contribute to marine resource degradation Medard 2017

We present an analysis of the O. cyanea catch data for the first two years of temporary closures based on landings data collected from village-based octopus collectors. We found a significant closure effect in terms of total weight and number of octopus caught on opening days, but observed that these benefits dissipated quickly, returning to pre-closure levels within days. Mean octopus size increased by 41\% on average when compared to data from selected control sites. However, extremely high levels of fishing effort on opening days meant that these biological effects did not translate into increased weight of octopus caught per successful fisher over the opening tide. Upon opening of concurrent closures during the second round of closures we found significant increases in the weight of octopus caught per successful fisher. We conclude that the pilot closures had a significant closure effect, but caution against isolated openings leading to concentrated fishing effort on opening days.},

	abstract = {The market demand for octopus grows each year, but landings are decreasing, and prices are rising. The present study investigated (1) diversity of Octopodidae in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) and (2) connectivity and genetic structure of Octopus cyanea and O. vulgaris populations in order to obtain baseline data for management plans. A fragment of the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene was sequenced in 275 octopus individuals from Madagascar, Kenya and Tanzania. In addition, 41 sequences of O. vulgaris from South Africa, Brazil, Amsterdam Island, Tristan da Cunha, Senegal and Galicia were retrieved from databases and included in this study. Five different species were identified using DNA barcoding, with first records for O. oliveri and Callistoctopus luteus in the WIO. For O. cyanea (n = 229, 563 bp), 22 haplotypes were found, forming one haplogroup. AMOVA revealed shallow but significant genetic population structure among all sites (ϕST = 0.025, p = 0.02), with significant differentiation among: (1) Kanamai, (2) southern Kenya, Tanzania, North and West Madagascar, (3) Southwest Madagascar and (4) East Madagascar (ϕCT = 0.035, p = 0.017). For O. vulgaris (n = 71, 482 bp), 15 haplotypes were identified, forming three haplogroups. A significant genetic population structure was found among all sites (ϕST = 0.82, p � 0.01). Based on pairwise ϕST-values and hierarchical AMOVAs, populations of O. vulgaris could be grouped as follows: (1) Brazil, (2) Madagascar and (3) all other sites. A significant increase in genetic distance with increasing geographic distance was found (Z = 232443, 81 r = 0.36, p = 0.039). These results indicate that for O. cyanea four regions should be considered as separate management units in the WIO. The very divergent haplogroups in O. vulgaris from Brazil and Madagascar might be evolving towards speciation and therefore should be considered as separate species in FAO statistics.},

	abstract = {The Mozambique Channel region in East Africa has diverse marine ecosystems and serves as a migratory corridor for economically important species. Local and foreign industrial fisheries operate in the Mozambique Channel, but regional small-scale fisheries are the crucially important fisheries that provide food security, livelihoods, and economic opportunities for rural coastal communities. This study reconstructed and investigated trends in the fishing effort and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of small-scale marine fisheries in four Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) that constitute the Mozambique Channel, i.e., Union of Comoros, Madagascar, Mayotte, and Mozambique, from 1950 to 2016. Effective fishing effort for small-scale fisheries in the form of fishing capacity in kWdays (i.e., kilowatt days) was derived using the number, length, motorization (engine power) by fishing vessels, as well as an approximate human-powered equivalent for shore-based fishers without vessels, as well as days of fishing per year. Effective small-scale fishing effort in the Mozambique Channel increased by nearly 60 times from just over 386,000 kWdays in 1950 to over 23 million kWdays in 2016. Correspondingly, the overall small-scale CPUE, based on previously and independently reconstructed catch data declined by 91\% in the region as a whole, from just under 175 kg⋅kWday
              –1
              in the early 1950s to just over 15 kg⋅kWday
              –1
              in recent years. All four EEZs showed the strongest declines in the small-scale CPUE in the earlier decades, driven by motorization and growth in vessel numbers impacting effective fishing effort. Increased motorization combined with a substantial growth in overall vessel numbers were the drivers of the increasing fishing effort and decreasing CPUE, and clearly suggest that continuing to increase the fishing capacity of small-scale fisheries in the absence of effective and restrictive management actions may exacerbate overexploitation risk.},

Review of gaps in knowledge and challenges
Played pivotal role in understanding neuron/nervous system
We are now studying suction cups and color changing abilities
Only 8\% species have well known biology, ecology, and physiology  (see citation)
Genetics:
Hard to assemble for a bunch of genetics reasons
Technologies are improving which will improve phylogenies
Recently discovered that not monophyletic but still discrepencies in research
This will further clarify if certain traits are derived or due to convergent evolution.
Current research in plasticity: Current research in RNA editing (more than half of translated gene transcripts are edited tbh idk what that actually means)
Aquaculture:
Some small-scale fisheries but lots of room for improvement in husbandry techniques
Will probably be improved through domestication as opposed to cultivating wild type
Environmental DNA:
It is anticipated that studies of eDNA will increasingly foxus on meta-genomic surveys of entire ecosystems to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity
Most of the unknown species are pelagic bc hard to find and observe and collect direct tissue samples
Roughly 45\% of all known cephalopod species are non-commercially important open-ocean or deep-sea squids and octopods (Sweeney and Roper, 1998). Application of eDNA methods have been shown to work for detecting and monitoring not only common species, but also those that are endangered, invasive, or elusive (Bohmann et al., 2014), and it could therefore be an especially potent tool for presence/absence monitoring of pelagic cephalopod species. POTENTIAL QUESTION PERCHANCE
eDNA doesn't persist in environment for long (Thomsen et al) so results are real time and can be applied on any timescale
Developing in situ eDNA technology
O vulgaris visual predation and metabolic activity (Nande et al 2017)
Convo about improving aquaculture may have good info but idk
Finally, reproduction in cephalopods is further complicated by the existence of polyandry (e.g., Naud et al., 2005; Squires et al., 2012, 2014; Morse et al., 2018), sperm competition (e.g., Hanlon et al., 1999; Wada et al., 2005) and multiple male mating strategies that exist in several species of cephalopods (Hanlon et al., 2005; Iwata et al., 2011).
(Iglesias et al., 2007; Vidal et al., 2014) MIGHT have paralarval mortality rates
Climate Change:
Issues: warming, acidification, changes in dissolved oxygen
For cephs: it may increase growth rates (if enough food and oxygen are available), consequently accelerating their life cycles (Doubleday et al., 2016) and increasing population turnover (Pecl and Jackson, 2008).
May also increase premature hatching (Repolho et al., 2014; Caamal-Monsreal et al., 2016; Uriarte et al., 2016)
See if a thermal window has been established for study pops?
Those in arctic and antarctic may be more susceptible but what about equator?
Global changes in oceanic currents may also affect the planktonic paralarvae of cephalopods, and the consequences of this may be positive, negative or both depending on the species (Xavier et al., 2015).
A bunch of other effects listed
altering development time and hatching rate (Kaplan et al., 2013; Xavier et al., 2015).
Potential positive effects include the colonization of new areas and consequent expansion of species range (Zeidberg and Robison, 2007; Golikov et al., 2013), while potential negative effects include changes in food availability and impacts to the transport of early life stages (Pierce et al., 2010)
Although some information regarding the effects of isolated aspects of global climate change on cephalopods exists in the literature, the impact of combined effects (i.e., ocean warming plus acidification and marine hypoxia, etc.) are, to date, poorly known. POTENTIAL QS
One recent study suggests that the plasticity inherent to cephalopods may allow them to adapt more rapidly than other animal groups: coleoid cephalopods exhibit unprecedented levels of posttranscriptional modification to RNA, allowing the diversification of proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint (Liscovitch-Brauer et al., 2017).
Nevertheless, while cephalopods may benefit in some ways from a changing ocean environment (Doubleday et al., 2016), population dynamics are difficult to predict and human activities may yet have unpredictable deleterious effects. I  AN DO DAT
One potential model for cephalopod welfare assessment is a scored model, based on animals’ physiology (e.g., respiration, osmotic balance, nutrition) and behavior (e.g., feeding, rest, sexual behavior), such as the one designed for the Atlantic salmon Salmo salar by Stien et al. (2013) THIS IS A HUMANE TREATMENT CONVO BUT IDK LOOK AT IT?
Unfortunately, without the ecological context of the natural environment, the survival value sensu Tinbergen (1963) of particular behaviors often cannot be perceived, leading to misinterpretations of evolutionary or ecological fitness. Thus, in order to improve understanding of cephalopod behavior, more field observations and field experiments are needed
Various types of tagging have beenutilized successfully in recent years to answer questions aboutgeographic range, migration and diving habits (Fuentes et al.,2006; Gilly et al., 2006; Replinger and Wood, 2007; Bazzinoet al., 2010; Barry et al., 2011; Sims et al., 2011; Wearmouthet al., 2013; Sykes et al., 2017b). SEE IF ANY ARE ABOUT MADAGASCAR
This would be in line with a recent suggestion by other authors (Xavier et al., 2015) who have urged a community-wide shift in focus from data acquisition to data analysis WOO DAS ME
Mentions behavior of o vulgaris
Ultimately, [] plasticity may explain some of cephalopod’s extraordinary evolutionary success, including their evolutionary persistence through three mass extinctions and recent increases in population despite (or perhaps because of) the effects of global climate change as discussed by Doubleday et al. (2016).
Pollutants may have effect as many species live near shore
Considering the rapid pace of anthropologically induced environmental change, it is important that to get a behavioral “baseline” of vulnerable species as quickly as possible, since such information can be used to guide future environmental and fishing regulations that will mitigate the effects of these pollutants and climatic shifts SEE IF ANY CITATIONS CAN HELP YOU

	abstract = {The artisanal ﬁshery in south-west Madagascar, around the coastal cities of Morondava, Morombe and Tule´ar, is particularly active. In the Morombe and Tule´ar regions, ﬁshing pressure focuses on coral formations close to landing sites and reef ﬁsh constitute the main part of the catch (Lethrinidae, Haemulidae, Siganidae). In Morondava, ﬁshing is practised very close to the shore on sandy substrates, but also on offshore reef shallows. The catches are more diverse and made up of reef ﬁsh (Serranidae, Lutjanidae) and non-reef species. Fishing from Morondava targets the highest trophic level of the coral reefs (piscivores/ macroinvertebrate feeders: 87\% of the catch) whereas in Tule´ar and Morombe the higher ﬁshing effort means that lower trophic levels are targeted to maintain catches. Despite the high ﬁshing effort, especially around Morombe and Tule´ar (standardizing ﬁshing effort of 5200 hook h km–2 year–1 and of 12 300 hook h km–2 year–1, respectively), the catch per unit effort (CPUE) is still relatively high; it varies from 0.6 to 2 kg h-1 per person over the whole zone and seems to be more linked to the ﬁshing method used and to the degree of professionalism than to variations in the abundance of the resources surrounding the three cities. The relatively high CPUE can probably be explained by a continual immigration and/or recruitment on these ﬁshing grounds. The ﬁsh originate from sectors that are far from towns and weakly exploited. A sociological study was carried out concurrently with the ﬁshing survey and focused on present-day transformations within the ﬁshing community.},

Locational taboos in fishing
MPA HISTORY
the first two of the three existing MPAs were created in 1989 and 1997 using a top-down, terrestrial-based protected area procedure that placed little emphasis on community consultation. In 1996, the first legal framework to introduce the sharing of responsibility over the natural resource management among users was created, known as Gestion Locale Se´curise´e (GELOSE) [35]. This law allows communities to define their own goals and develop regulations for resource use and management in the form of by-laws, as long as these rules are consistent with national policy (i.e. you cannot develop a regulation that allows the use of a gear which is banned by national legislation) [35]. As with many other forms of environmental policy in Madagascar, GELOSE was developed for terrestrial ecosystems and then applied to marine resources. In 1999, the first GELOSE site was applied to a mangrove social-ecological system in Tulear.
In 2007, the community-based management of fishing grounds, including available marine habitats, was officially launched in the Masoala Peninsula region of Eastern Madagascar. Likewise, communities in Nosy Ve and Velondriake, in the South Western Coast have been managing resources without an official GELOSE agreement.
community-based marine resource management initiatives have had to operate outside the GELOSE framework because rules were too rigid
Rules are enforced by and among local users. If anyone is caught breaking the rule, the management committee enforce the dina.
Both systems have clearly defined membership rights, conflict resolution mechanisms, rights to organize, and congruence between rules and local conditions.
However, this should be done in a way that acknowledges that heterogeneity of institutions is critical and that there is not a one-size-fits-all policy to model institutions after [36].

@article{RoleConsumers,
	title = {Role as consumers},
	abstract = {Cephalopods are voracious, versatile predators. They generally have a short life span and a single spawning event followed by death. Populations are subject to dramatic fluctuations and their impact on prey populations is equally variable. The prehensile arms and tentacles of cephalopods, coupled with a highly evolved sensory system, allow them to occupy a broad trophic niche and migrations enable populations to exploit the temporal and spatial variability of production systems and populations of prey. Shoaling is a common behavioural feature of many species which facilitates prey capture and contributes to the impact of cephalopods on prey populations. Research on cephalopod stomach contents is hampered because the beak is used to bite the prey into small pieces so hard parts, which are usually needed for identification of prey species, are often rejected causing potential bias in estimation of diet. Cephalopods may also feed unnaturally in the presence of sampling gear. Despite these problems there is a growing body of data on cephalopod predation collected using direct observations, conventional visual analysis of stomach contents and serological methods. Most species feed on small crustaceans as juveniles and shift the diet to larger fish and other cephalopods during growth. This shift is accompanied by ontogenetic changes in the allometry of the brachial crown. There is increasing evidence that myctophid fishes are an important food resource for oceanic squid. The diet and stock size of some commercially exploited squid populations is sufficiently well known to quantify the impact of a single generation on the prey community. Where there is predation on commercial stocks of fish and crustaceans, the effect of cephalopod feeding on recruitment may be significant. Cephalopods are trophic opportunists in marine food webs from polar to equatorial seas.},

          The global cephalopod trade is a multi-billion-dollar industry that involves fishing and captive breeding of a dozen species of high commercial value. It also contributes wholly or partly to the income and subsistence of thousands of families around the world. Despite its broad ecological, social, and economic importance, limited research has been conducted to describe the scope and scale of the global cephalopod trade. To date, there is no specific regulation, nor have tracking systems been implemented, to study the traceability of the global cephalopod trade at an international level. We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive description of the legal trade in cephalopods to understand who the key world players in the cephalopod seafood markets are. We analysed 20 years of records compiled by the United Nations COMTRADE database. The database contained 115,108 entries for squid and cuttlefish and 71,659 entries for octopus, including the product flow between traders (countries or territories) weighted by volume (kg) and monetary value (USD). Graph theoretic analysis was used to explore the emergent properties of this database through the analysis of different measures of centrality that provide insights on the key role of the traders in the network. Our findings show that most of the market movements between ca. 250 traders are led by three countries (China, Spain, and Japan), involving 11 clusters of traders based on the volume and value of cephalopod trade and number of transactions. The most important cluster, that dominates the cephalopod seafood market, is composed by 5 Asian countries (China, India, Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam), 2 European countries (the Netherlands and Spain) and the USA. This work identifies the traders that act as major exporters and/or importers, the modulators, intermediaries or accumulators, the best-connected traders, the principal flow routes and the weaknesses of the global cephalopod trade network. This network information is essential to advance towards a transparent and sustainable cephalopods world trade.},

Yet despite its exploitation and importance in many artisanal fisheries throughout the world, little is known about its life history, ecology and vulnerability. We used stylet increment analysis to age a wild O. cyanea population for the first time and gonad histology to examine their reproductive characteristics. O. cyanea conforms to many cephalopod life history generalisations having rapid, non-asymptotic growth, a short life-span and high levels of mortality. Males were found to mature at much younger ages and sizes than females with reproductive activity concentrated in the spring and summer months. The female dominated sex-ratios in association with female brooding behaviours also suggest that larger conspicuous females may be more prone to capture and suggests that this intertidal octopus population has the potential to be negatively impacted in an unregulated fishery. Size at age and maturity comparisons between our temperate bordering population and lower latitude Tanzanian and Hawaiian populations indicated stark differences in growth rates that correlate with water temperatures. The variability in life history traits between global populations suggests that management of O. cyanea populations should be tailored to each unique set of life history characteristics and that stylet increment analysis may provide the integrity needed to accurately assess this.},

It has been suggested that the dynamics of multi agent learning can be studied using replicator equations from population biology. Most existing studies so far have been limited to discrete strategy spaces with a small number of available actions. In many cases, however, the choices available to agents are better characterized by continuous spectra. This paper suggests a generalization of the replicator framework that allows to study the adaptive dynamics of Q-learning agents with continuous strategy spaces. Instead of probability vectors, agents’ strategies are now characterized by probability measures over continuous variables. As a result, the ordinary differential equations for the discrete case are replaced by a system of coupled integral-differential replicator equations that describe the mutual evolution of individual agent strategies. We derive a set of functional equations describing the steady state of the replicator dynamics, examine their solutions for several two-player games, and conﬁrm our analytical results using simulations.},

While fisheries are widely considered a male-dominated industry, women play a significant and vital role in the survival of small-scale family-run fisheries and are frequently the driving force of innovation, diversification, and the development of new markets. However, these roles are often unseen – with the male fishers being the registered beneficiary and performer of more visible tasks. Although several fisheries studies have focused on gender, no study has yet considered or contextualized the impact of Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) on both the visibility and empowerment of women. Drawing on a quantitative survey of 113 FLAGs and the qualitative case study of three EU fisheries areas, this paper explores these factors. While the results show that FLAGs are active in supporting women in diversification activities, the findings highlight that their impact on women’s empowerment is complex, varies between areas, and that interventional programs play an important role in identifying gender issues in fisheries areas and how they impact their transformation and survival.},

Vezo communities in the region of Andavadoaka, a remote village of 1,200 people located on the southwest coast of Madagascar (Figure 1), some 50 km south of Morombe, have subsisted from traditional and artisanal fishing activities for generations
. Bleaching events have continued in recent years as a result of periods of anomalous warming of sea surface temperature.
Marine surveys have revealed that following bleaching - related mortality, many of the reefs in the region have undergone a general phase shift from coral to algal - dominated habitats (Harding et al. 2006).
dramatic increase in fishing activities in recent years. Coastal population growth, and the concomitant increasing need for marine resources, has been rapid, exacerbated by high levels of migration towards coastal zones
HISTORY
The population of the Toliara region grew by 324 \% between 1975 and 1993 (Cooke et al.2000). Limited employment opportunities, combined with low agricultural productivity, resulted in a five - fold increase in the fishing population in a period of 17 years leading up to the early 1990ties, causing an overexploitation of marine resources, especially near urban centres such as Toliara (Gabrié et al. 2000). Laroche et al. (1997) provide evidence that over - fishing in the Toliara region has led fishers to target lower value fish in an effort to sustain yields in the face of reduced stocks of large piscivorous species.
At the beginning of the new century, over 50 \% of the artisanal fishing in Madagascar was estimated to occur along the reef systems of the southwest (Cooke et al. 2000). The village of Andavadoaka, at the geographical centre of this project area, has seen a doubling of population input rate (births and immigration arrivals per year) in the 10 years leading up to 2003, with over 50 \% of the population being aged 14 or under. Fishing is the primary economic activity for 71 \% of villagers (Langley et al. 2006)
ALSO GOES OVER HISTORY OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND SOCIAL MONITORING
Can result in increased octopus after reopening
It remains to be seen what the long - term ecological and fisheries effects of the octopus NTZs will be, since both the short - and long - term effects of the permanent protected areas and other managed zones within the expanded Velondriake network remain unknown
Ecotourism may affect perceived value
Despite encouraging community support of, and adherence to, local management plans, villages have no assurance that the local laws established during the creation of Velondriake will be either known to, or respected by, outside or migrant resource users.

Analysis of intra-community social stratifications in relation to participation in conservation is important to the pursuit of environmental justice as well as improved efficacy of a given con­ servation intervention. While a large body of literature broadly examines intra and inter-community dynamics in relation to community-based conservation, few have specifically quantified how wealth influences one’s participation in community-based conservation initiatives, especially in the marine realm. To address these questions, we interviewed people living near marine conservation initiatives in Madagascar. Using a principle component analysis, we created an asset-based wealth index and showed that both knowledge of and partici­ pation in marine conservation was positively correlated with wealth. Specifically, three of the four participation categories were statistically correlated with wealth, including involvement in any element of the conservation project, involvement in decision-making, and in enforcement. However, wealth was not significantly correlated with participation in monitoring. Ultimately our research highlights the importance of understanding underlying drivers of participation in community-based conservation. If the poorest in a community are underrepresented in local participation, the conservation initiative will not only be unjust, but will also likely be less effective.},

Although conservation organizations may adopt the normative value of “whole community” participation, numerous scholars show how many conservation organizations globally still fail to recognize intracommunity social stratifications that influence who benefits from and bears the burden of conservation interventions (Baker-M´edard, 2017; Aswani et al., 2017; Stone and Nyaupane, 2014; Gross-Camp et al., 2019; Brosius et al., 2005; Agarwal, 2010; Mollett, 2010; Leach et al., 1999; Kull, 2002; Hanson, 2012)
MORE HISTORY OF MPAS
Lastly, the final category of responses emphasized the importance of identity in shaping why certain people do not participate in marine resource management. Among women, a common phrase was “the project doesn’t want women.5 ” Similar to findings regarding formal educational attainment and wealth, numerous studies show that women, especially widowed or single women are overrepresented in low socio-economic categories (Filmer, 2020; Bradshaw et al., 2017). This response from women in the lowest wealth quintile corresponds to a trend in the marine conservation literature showing a generalized lack of women’s participation in marine resource management (Baker-M´edard, 2017; Bennett, 2005; Gissi et al., 2018; Kleiber et al., 2015).
conservation initiatives may exacerbate class-based inequalities in a community. Additionally, from an efficacy standpoint, if a subset of a community is not involved in conservation efforts, the conservation intervention is likely going to be less effective

Drawing on extensive expert experiences, the review of literature, fisheries databases, international and regional agency reports, NGO and government reports and case studies from West and East Africa, we demonstrate two critical findings. First, fisheries governance mechanisms in Africa act largely to constrain small-scale fisheries (SSF) while failing to contain the industrial fisheries sector, resulting in the marginalisation of the SSF. Secondly, despite a higher incidence of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in industrial fisheries than the SSF, fisheries governance mechanisms continue to advance the ’Survival of the Richest’ – the industrial sector, to the detriment of the ’Fittest’ – the SSF. The SSF supports millions of jobs and is better adapted to meet the continents’ nutrition and socio-economic security. For the fisheries sector to contribute to the sustainable development of Africans, states must redirect governance towards regulating the industrial sector, emphasising equitable access for the SSF whilst prioritising ecological sustainability.},

where small-scale fishers are susceptible to engaging in activities that directly or indirectly undermine national security, such as piracy/armed robbery at sea, and oil pipeline vandalization, among others.
. In effect, states must recognize the impact of these measures to SSF as ignoring such low level social and economic issues may manifest as high-level political issues that relate to peace and economic stability critical to a nation’s survival ([68]: 67–85).
how the low visibility relating to under-representation in decision making of SSF might influence fisheries governance mechanisms that may inadvertently contribute to their alienation while accommodating DWFNs and international agreements that may, in fact, be a greater threat to fisheries resource health, human and national security [11,72].
, women significantly contribute to Africa’s fisheries production. According to Harper et al. ([47]: 8), of the 2.9 million tonnes of fish caught globally by women each year, over 260,000 tonnes of these are caught by African women. Women also finance the fishing activities of men, especially in West Africa; as such, they are vital to the sustenance of the SSF sector in Africa [92]. Women also dominate the post-harvest and marketing sub-sector, accounting for 58\% of the trade and processing of SSF catch, whilst owning only 3.6\% of the fishing boats ([89]:10). In West Africa alone, as much as 80\% of fish trade is conducted by women ([44]:2). Therefore, the sector is critical to achieving social equity, in line with goals 5 (gender equality) and 10 (reduced inequality) of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, and the aspiration of sustainable development of Africans as enshrined in the Agenda 2063 of the African Union [69].
how large-scale fisheries development constitutes social, economic, and political components of fisheries governance in Africa which advances economic interest whilst undermining the socio-cultural wellbeing and fisheries sustainability.
HISTORY
. Despite evidence that shows the harmful nature of some of the activities of the industrial sector, such as overfishing and IUU fishing, conservation measures have either been disproportionately directed at the SSF and or the SSF are expected to give up their traditional fishing grounds in a bid to advance the economic agendas of African government.

	abstract = {Octopus fisheries are important at the southwest coast of Madagascar. Fishermen traditionally dried and sold octopus in the local market. Recently, an international company has developed a new lucrative market for the octopus. It has led to an increase in the value and exploitation of this species. Increase in fishing intensity has resulted in an over exploitation of the stock. The aim of this study was to find out the current situation of the fishery and the possibilities for economic improvement for the fishery. A bioeconomic model developed by Arnason was used to describe the fishery. The model has calculated the profitability of the fishery and the state of the stock. The results from the fishery indicate that actual fishing effort (no. of fishermen) is about three times more than required to earn maximum sustainable economic benefits from the octopus fishery. There is no management in place so this indicates the need of a fisheries management system. Several types of management are proposed to alleviate the fisheries and community fishing right will be likely appropriate to this fishery. This report also will study the possible implementation of this community management.},

In accordance with international guidelines, the integration effort on the coastal zone concerns the local, regional, and national levels. The ﬁeld study we conducted in Madagascar in 1999 and 2000 showed that the results achieved by this program vary signiﬁcantly from one level of action to another. In particular, the ICM process seems to be more difﬁcult to initiate at the regional level. This paper presents the observations leading to this diagnostic, and enlightens some fundamental mechanisms that can explain it.

octopus No-Take Zone (NTZ) in the region, based  on fisheries data collected between September 2003 and June 2006 are presented. The results show that the number and mean weight of octopus caught increased significantly after closure periods of the NTZ. However, the high intensity of fishing on the opening days reduced the potential longer term benefits of the first NTZ closure, and a
reduction in fishing pressure on the second opening lead to longer-lasting benefits.
This study demonstrates that seasonal, temporary closures of fishing sites are potentially a strong management tool in maintaining the sustainability of a traditional octopus fishery. The active participation and support of the local fishers was key to the success in the implementation and 
respect of the NTZ.},

	abstract = {Cephalopods are voracious, versatile predators. They generally have a short life span and a single spawning event followed by death. Populations are subject to dramatic fluctuations and their impact on prey populations is equally variable. The prehensile arms and tentacles of cephalopods, coupled with a highly evolved sensory system, allow them to occupy a broad trophic niche and migrations enable populations to exploit the temporal and spatial variability of production systems and populations of prey. Shoaling is a common behavioural feature of many species which facilitates prey capture and contributes to the impact of cephalopods on prey populations. Research on cephalopod stomach contents is hampered because the beak is used to bite the prey into small pieces so hard parts, which are usually needed for identification of prey species, are often rejected causing potential bias in estimation of diet. Cephalopods may also feed unnaturally in the presence of sampling gear. Despite these problems there is a growing body of data on cephalopod predation collected using direct observations, conventional visual analysis of stomach contents and serological methods. Most species feed on small crustaceans as juveniles and shift the diet to larger fish and other cephalopods during growth. This shift is accompanied by ontogenetic changes in the allometry of the brachial crown. There is increasing evidence that myctophid fishes are an important food resource for oceanic squid. The diet and stock size of some commercially exploited squid populations is sufficiently well known to quantify the impact of a single generation on the prey community. Where there is predation on commercial stocks of fish and crustaceans, the effect of cephalopod feeding on recruitment may be significant. Cephalopods are trophic opportunists in marine food webs from polar to equatorial seas.},
