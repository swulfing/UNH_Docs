Previous modelling approaches have focused primarily on local and/or global scales, while regional scale models have been relatively few. In this study, regional scale predictive habitat models are presented for deep-sea corals for the U.S. West Coast (California, Oregon and Washington). Model results are intended to aid in future research or mapping efforts and to assess potential coral habitat suitability both within and outside existing bottom trawl closures (i.e. Essential Fish Habitat (EFH)) and identify suitable habitat within U.S. National Marine Sanctuaries (NMS). Deep-sea coral habitat suitability was modelled at 500 m6500 m spatial resolution using a range of physical, chemical and environmental variables known or thought to influence the distribution of deep-sea corals. Using a spatial partitioning cross-validation approach, maximum entropy models identified slope, temperature, salinity and depth as important predictors for most deep-sea coral taxa. Large areas of highly suitable deep-sea coral habitat were predicted both within and outside of existing bottom trawl closures and NMS boundaries. Predicted habitat suitability over regional scales are not currently able to identify coral areas with pin point accuracy and probably overpredict actual coral distribution due to model limitations and unincorporated variables (i.e. data on distribution of hard substrate) that are known to limit their distribution. Predicted habitat results should be used in conjunction with multibeam bathymetry, geological mapping and other tools to guide future research efforts to areas with the highest probability of harboring deep-sea corals. Field validation of predicted habitat is needed to quantify model accuracy, particularly in areas that have not been sampled.},

	abstract = {The enhancement of salmon populations has long been used to increase the abundance of salmon returning to spawn and/ or to be captured in fisheries. However, in some instances enhancement can have adverse impacts on adjacent nonenhanced populations. In Canada’s Skeena watershed, smolt-to-adult survival of Babine Lake sockeye from 1962–2002 was inversely related to the abundance of sockeye smolts leaving Babine Lake. This relationship has led to the concern that Babine Lake smolt production, which is primarily enhanced by spawning channels, may depress wild Skeena (Babine and non-Babine) sockeye populations as a result of increased competition between wild and enhanced sockeye smolts as they leave their natal lakes and co-migrate to sea. To test this hypothesis we used data on Skeena sockeye populations and oceanographic conditions to statistically examine the relationship between Skeena sockeye productivity (adult salmon produced per spawner) and an index of Babine Lake enhanced smolt abundance while accounting for the potential influence of early marine conditions. While we had relatively high power to detect large effects, we did not find support for the hypothesis that the productivity of wild Skeena sockeye is inversely related to the abundance of enhanced sockeye smolts leaving Babine Lake in a given year. Importantly, life-time productivity of Skeena sockeye is only partially explained by marine survival, and likely is an unreliable measure of the influence of smolt abundance. Limitations to our analyses, which include: (1) the reliance upon adult salmon produced per spawner (rather than per smolt) as an index of marine survival, and (2) incomplete age structure for most of the populations considered, highlight uncertainties that should be addressed if understanding relationships between wild and enhanced sockeye is a priority in the Skeena.},

After deﬁning the term ‘footprint’ and evaluating the availability of reliable baseline information we review the published literature to synthesize the footprints of climate change impacts in marine Arctic ecosystems reported as of mid-2009. We found a total of 51 reports of documented changes in Arctic marine biota in response to climate change. Among the responses evaluated were range shifts and changes in abundance, growth/condition, behaviour/phenology and community/regime shifts. Most reports concerned marine mammals, particularly polar bears, and ﬁsh. The number of well-documented changes in planktonic and benthic systems was surprisingly low. Evident losses of endemic species in the Arctic Ocean, and in ice algae production and associated community remained difﬁcult to evaluate due to the lack of quantitative reports of its abundance and distribution. Very few footprints of climate change were reported in the literature from regions such as the wide Siberian shelf and the central Arctic Ocean due to the limited research effort made in these ecosystems. Despite the alarming nature of warming and its strong potential effects in the Arctic Ocean the research effort evaluating the impacts of climate change in this region is rather limited.},

Developing theoretical models of coupled human-environment systems is a continuing area of research, although relatively few of these models are based on diﬀerential equations. Here we develop a simple diﬀerential equation coupled human-environment system model of coupled forest growth dynamics and conservationist opinion dynamics in a human population. The model assumes logistic growth and harvesting in the forest. Opinion spread in the human population is based the interplay between conservation values stimulated by forest rarity, and injunctive social norms that tend to support population conformity. We ﬁnd that injunctive social norms drive the system to the boundaries of phase space, whereas rarity-based conservation priorities drive the system to the interior. The result is complex dynamics including limit cycles and alternative stable states that do not occur if injunctive social norms are absent. We also ﬁnd that increasing the inherent perceived value of forests is the best way to boost and stabilize forest cover while also boosting conservationist opinion in the population. We conclude that simple models can provide insights and suggest patterns that might be harder to see with complicated, high-dimensional models, and therefore should be pursued more often in research on coupled human-environment systems.},

Based on biological records, the secondary spread of the European green crab Carcinus maenas has maintained a relatively consistent rate of advance for over 100 yr, covering a wide range of temperate latitudes and local hydrological environments along the Atlantic coast of North America. We employed a discrete-time model to investigate the green crab’s spreading speed and the relationship between demography and dispersal. The model is an age-structured integro-difference equation that couples a matrix for population growth and a dispersal kernel for spread of individuals within a season. The choice of a Normal or Laplace distribution for the dispersal kernel has only a minimal effect on the spreading speed. Our modeling exercise illustrates that there are many realistic combinations of vital rates (fecundity and survival) and dispersal rates that give rise to a given spreading speed c*. Further, our results indicate that the invasion speed is most sensitive to the standard deviation of larval dispersal, followed by recruitment rate (a demographic parameter that combines fecundity, larval survival, and juvenile survival), and least sensitive to adult survival. We thus enhance understanding of invasion biology, specifically the relative importance of demography versus dispersal distance for marine species with a pelagic larval stage. We also provide insights on and rank possible management strategies.},

	abstract = {A signiﬁcant global challenge lies in our current inability to anticipate, and therefore prepare for, critical ecological thresholds (i.e. tipping points in ecosystems). This deﬁcit stems largely from an inadequate understanding of the many complex interactions between species and the environment at the ecosystem level, and the paucity of mechanistic models relating environment to population dynamics at the species level. In marine ecosystems, abundant, short-lived and fast-growing species such as anchovies or squids, consistently function as ‘keystone’ groups whose population dynamics affect entire ecosystems. Increasing exploitation coupled with climate change impacts has the potential to affect these ecological groups and consequently, the entire marine ecosystem. There are currently very few models that predict the impact of climate change on these keystone groups. Here we use a combination of individual-based bioenergetics and stage-structured population models to characterize the fundamental capacity of cephalopods to respond to climate change. We demonstrate the potential for, and mechanisms behind, two unfavourable climate-change-induced thresholds in future population dynamics. Although one threshold was the direct consequence of a decrease in incubation time caused by ocean warming, the other threshold was linked to survivorship, implying the possibility of management through a modiﬁcation of ﬁshing mortality. Additional substantive changes in phenology were also predicted, with a possible loss in population resilience. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting complex nonlinear dynamics with a reasonably simplistic mechanistic model, and highlight the necessity of developing such approaches for other species if attempts to moderate the impact of climate change on natural resources are to be effective.},

	abstract = {Carbonate hardparts of marine organisms are frequently explored archives of their ambient seawater composi­ tion. Among the various materials used, the hardparts of molluscs are particularly relevant because their accretionary growth allows for the compilation of time-resolved proxy data sets. Here, we explore to which extent the calcium isotope values of aragonitic cephalopod hardparts represent proxies for seawater composition or record a trophic level signal. In a first step, we collect Ca isotope data from a diverse set of modern cepha­ lopods, including Nautilus, Sepia and Spirula. These taxa differ in their external/internal hardparts, life spans, trophic levels, habitat depth, hinterland geology, and resulting runoff. In a second step, we have put these concepts to the test and explore the calcium isotope signatures of Lower Cretaceous (lower Albian) wellpreserved cephalopods (nautiloids, ammonoids and belemnites) and bivalve shells from Madagascar. In the sense of a methodological comparison, two measurement approaches (double spike (δ44/40Ca, TIMS) and bracketing standard (δ44/42Ca, MC-ICP-MS) techniques are applied. Calcium from organic matter and intra-shell variations on bulk δ44/40Ca isotope values are explored. Four protocols (H2O2, NaOH, HClO4, incineration up to 250 ◦C including subsequent rinsing with deionised water and Ca removal) are applied to destroy organic matter in the shell material and to dissolve any non‑carbonate bound Ca, i.e., its metastable secondary Ca reservoir. These are equally successful, and the Ca isotope values of the purified carbonate phase plot on the equilibrium mass fractionation line. Samples not treated to destroy or remove their organic matter do not fall on the equi­ librium mass fractionation line. Limitations of sample pre-treatment are reflected by a slight shift towards lower values in the case of incineration experiments at 650 ◦C. This feature is best explained in the context of a mineralogical phase transformation of aragonite to calcite. Calcium isotope values show no significant variability when sampling hardparts with different microstructures (callus, nacre, prismatic layer) and mineralised during different ontogenetic phases (outer shell, septa). Perhaps most relevant, mean δ44/40Ca (‰ SRM-915a) isotope values for Nautilus (0.72‰ ±0.19 2SD), Sepia (0.79‰ ±0.18 2SD), and Spirula (0.50‰ ±0.18 2SD) lack evidence for a significant control by trophic levels. Nitrogen isotope data and known diets for all three cephalopods serve as a litmus test for these data, which do not correlate with this dietary proxy information. These results are considered encouraging and suggest that Ca isotope values of cephalopod shells are proxies for their ambient seawater Ca isotope signatures. According to our data, however, it remains unclear to which extend cephalopod hardparts record the Ca isotopic composition of past seawater. Specifically, the data from three different modern species point to a mean Δ44/40Ca(ceph-seawater) fractionation of − 1.21‰ (± 0.15 2SD). Based on our work, we present a best practice guide for cephalopod Ca isotope analysis and interpretation.},

            The population density of Octopus vulgaris was measured by visual census with scuba diving in coastal areas in Greece (eastern Mediterranean). A time-variant, stage-classified, matrix population model was developed to interpret the seasonal variation of octopus stage densities and to estimate several life cycle parameters. An annual and a semi-annual periodic cycle were found in the stage densities. A main peak of benthic settlement was observed during summer and a secondary, irregular one during late autumn. Two spawning peaks were estimated, a main one during late winter–spring and a secondary one during late summer–early autumn. More than 50\% of the just-settled individuals will eventually die after 3 months. Mortality rate declines, as individuals grow larger, reaches a minimum approximately 6 months after settlement, and then grows again probably because of terminal spawning. The life expectancy of recently settled individuals ({\textless}50 g) during their summer peak is approximately 5 months. The lifespan of the common octopus is estimated to be between 12 and 15 months. The octopuses' mean specific growth rates (±s.d.) in their natural environment were 1.61 ± 0.30 d−1 for 50–200 g individuals and 1.19 ± 0.31 d−1 for 200–500 g individuals.},

	abstract = {Diet composition of nine commercially exploited fishery resources which contributes 55–60\% of the total fish landings in the northwest coast of India were analyzed in this study. Gut content analysis of the selected fish groups has shown significant variations in the prey composition and predator preference on a prey item. The diet matrix revealed Acetes sp. (32.74\%) as a key and common shared prey item, followed by mesopelagic fishes (30.51\%), other shrimps (11.00\%), digested material (7.42\%), crabs (4.03\%) and cephalopods (2.77\%), etc. In this study, Acetes sp was considered as a proxy for the non-penaeid prawns due to its significant contribution (92\%) to the total non-penaeid landings. Targeted exploitation of Acetes sp. has intensified recently (from 0.44 lakh t in 2004 to 1.40 lakh t in 2018) with an average annual growth rate of 11.2\% due to the demand from fish meal plants. By considering its ecological and fishery importance, Acetes sp. should be considered as keystone species in the ecosystem. The Schaefer surplus production model was used to calculate the Biological Reference Points (BRPs) and model parameters MSY, FMSY, r, EMSY, and K. The model fit was fair (R2 = 0.630) and significantly positive correlation was observed between CPUEobserved and CPUEmodel. The estimated optimum exploitation limits (p {\textless} 0.05) for the fishery were Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) as 1.20 lakh t and fishing effort required to harvest MSY (EMSY) as 51.30 lakh fishing hours. However, the recent exploitation yield and fishing effort are beyond the optimum exploitation limits. Further increase in exploitation of the resources may hamper the sustainability of the stocks and may lead to detrimental impact on the trophic interactions of the fishery resources. Technical interventions are needed in the field of post-harvest and value addition for attaining fair economic returns from the harvest which at present forms a low-value high-volume fishery. Sustainable exploitation and management measures need to be introduced and implemented for the Acetes sp. in order to sustain the stocks and to maintain the integrity of the fishery ecosystem.},

More recently, analyses of complete mitochondrial genomes and hundreds of nuclear loci have yielded similarly ambiguous results. In this study, we re-evaluate hypotheses of decapodiform relationships by increasing taxo­ nomic breadth and utilizing higher-quality genome and transcriptome data for several taxa. We also employ analytical approaches to (1) identify contamination in transcriptome data, (2) better assess model adequacy, and (3) account for potential biases. Using this larger data set, we consistently recover a clade comprising Myopsida (closed-eye squid), Sepiida (cuttlefishes), and Oegopsida (open-eye squid) that is sister to a Sepiolida (bobtail and bottletail squid) clade. Idiosepiida (pygmy squid) is consistently recovered as the sister group to all sampled decapodiform lineages. Further, a weighted Shimodaira-Hasegawa test applied to one of our larger data matrices rejects all alternatives to these ordinal-level relationships. At present, available nuclear genome-scale data support nested clades of relatively large-bodied decapodiform cephalopods to the exclusion of pygmy squids, but improved taxon sampling and additional genomic data will be needed to test these novel hypotheses rigorously.},

When effective, LMMAs can encourage responsible fishing, strengthen compliance and improve adaptive capacity, and may help to safeguard food security, address coastal poverty and increase resource sustainability. However, evidence that LMMAs can achieve long-term biological goals is limited. Here, we used a six-year dataset and a before-after-control-impact sampling design to assess the bio­ logical effectiveness of five community-managed no take zones (CMNTZs) situated within the Velondriake LMMA in southwest Madagascar. Linear mixed-effect models revealed that the difference in biomass between control and reserve sites increased over time. Significant differences in biomass between CMNTZs and controls were only evident from year two onwards, with 189\% more total biomass in CMNTZs than fished control sites by year six. There was no effect of CMNTZs on the biomass of fish families preferentially targeted by the local fishery, limiting the long-term fisheries benefits of this reserve network unless individual CMNTZs are made larger to accommodate the home ranges of fishery targeted families. There were however, reserve effects preventing the decline of untargeted fish families and species richness.},

Despite discursive and institutional shifts toward more “collaborative” and “community-based” conservation programing, there is a deficiency of women’s nominal as well as effective participation in community management organizations. This research shows that conservation organizations’ focus on proximate drivers of marine resource use, or a politics of picking the “low-hanging fruit,” over ultimate drivers such as global commodity chains, places disproportionate emphasis on marine spatial enclosures and restricting specific, and gendered, harvest methods. To address gender bias concerning access to and control over natural resources, we must go beyond the rhetoric of “community involvement” to address gendered inequalities in conservation decision making, and whose interests are served by conservation projects.},

	abstract = {This paper presents evidence of the fisheries effect of experimental temporary fishing closures for Octopus cyanea in the then-emergent Velondriake Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA) in south-west Madagascar during 2004–2006. We present an analysis of the O. cyanea catch data for the first two years of temporary closures based on landings data collected from village-based octopus collectors. We found a significant closure effect in terms of total weight and number of octopus caught on opening days, but observed that these benefits dissipated quickly, returning to pre-closure levels within days. Mean octopus size increased by 41\% on average when compared to data from selected control sites. However, extremely high levels of fishing effort on opening days meant that these biological effects did not translate into increased weight of octopus caught per successful fisher over the opening tide. Upon opening of concurrent closures during the second round of closures we found significant increases in the weight of octopus caught per successful fisher. We conclude that the pilot closures had a significant closure effect, but caution against isolated openings leading to concentrated fishing effort on opening days.},

	abstract = {The market demand for octopus grows each year, but landings are decreasing, and prices are rising. The present study investigated (1) diversity of Octopodidae in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) and (2) connectivity and genetic structure of Octopus cyanea and O. vulgaris populations in order to obtain baseline data for management plans. A fragment of the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene was sequenced in 275 octopus individuals from Madagascar, Kenya and Tanzania. In addition, 41 sequences of O. vulgaris from South Africa, Brazil, Amsterdam Island, Tristan da Cunha, Senegal and Galicia were retrieved from databases and included in this study. Five different species were identified using DNA barcoding, with first records for O. oliveri and Callistoctopus luteus in the WIO. For O. cyanea (n = 229, 563 bp), 22 haplotypes were found, forming one haplogroup. AMOVA revealed shallow but significant genetic population structure among all sites (ϕST = 0.025, p = 0.02), with significant differentiation among: (1) Kanamai, (2) southern Kenya, Tanzania, North and West Madagascar, (3) Southwest Madagascar and (4) East Madagascar (ϕCT = 0.035, p = 0.017). For O. vulgaris (n = 71, 482 bp), 15 haplotypes were identified, forming three haplogroups. A significant genetic population structure was found among all sites (ϕST = 0.82, p � 0.01). Based on pairwise ϕST-values and hierarchical AMOVAs, populations of O. vulgaris could be grouped as follows: (1) Brazil, (2) Madagascar and (3) all other sites. A significant increase in genetic distance with increasing geographic distance was found (Z = 232443, 81 r = 0.36, p = 0.039). These results indicate that for O. cyanea four regions should be considered as separate management units in the WIO. The very divergent haplogroups in O. vulgaris from Brazil and Madagascar might be evolving towards speciation and therefore should be considered as separate species in FAO statistics.},

	abstract = {The Mozambique Channel region in East Africa has diverse marine ecosystems and serves as a migratory corridor for economically important species. Local and foreign industrial fisheries operate in the Mozambique Channel, but regional small-scale fisheries are the crucially important fisheries that provide food security, livelihoods, and economic opportunities for rural coastal communities. This study reconstructed and investigated trends in the fishing effort and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of small-scale marine fisheries in four Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) that constitute the Mozambique Channel, i.e., Union of Comoros, Madagascar, Mayotte, and Mozambique, from 1950 to 2016. Effective fishing effort for small-scale fisheries in the form of fishing capacity in kWdays (i.e., kilowatt days) was derived using the number, length, motorization (engine power) by fishing vessels, as well as an approximate human-powered equivalent for shore-based fishers without vessels, as well as days of fishing per year. Effective small-scale fishing effort in the Mozambique Channel increased by nearly 60 times from just over 386,000 kWdays in 1950 to over 23 million kWdays in 2016. Correspondingly, the overall small-scale CPUE, based on previously and independently reconstructed catch data declined by 91\% in the region as a whole, from just under 175 kg⋅kWday
              –1
              in the early 1950s to just over 15 kg⋅kWday
              –1
              in recent years. All four EEZs showed the strongest declines in the small-scale CPUE in the earlier decades, driven by motorization and growth in vessel numbers impacting effective fishing effort. Increased motorization combined with a substantial growth in overall vessel numbers were the drivers of the increasing fishing effort and decreasing CPUE, and clearly suggest that continuing to increase the fishing capacity of small-scale fisheries in the absence of effective and restrictive management actions may exacerbate overexploitation risk.},

	abstract = {The artisanal ﬁshery in south-west Madagascar, around the coastal cities of Morondava, Morombe and Tule´ar, is particularly active. In the Morombe and Tule´ar regions, ﬁshing pressure focuses on coral formations close to landing sites and reef ﬁsh constitute the main part of the catch (Lethrinidae, Haemulidae, Siganidae). In Morondava, ﬁshing is practised very close to the shore on sandy substrates, but also on offshore reef shallows. The catches are more diverse and made up of reef ﬁsh (Serranidae, Lutjanidae) and non-reef species. Fishing from Morondava targets the highest trophic level of the coral reefs (piscivores/ macroinvertebrate feeders: 87\% of the catch) whereas in Tule´ar and Morombe the higher ﬁshing effort means that lower trophic levels are targeted to maintain catches. Despite the high ﬁshing effort, especially around Morombe and Tule´ar (standardizing ﬁshing effort of 5200 hook h km–2 year–1 and of 12 300 hook h km–2 year–1, respectively), the catch per unit effort (CPUE) is still relatively high; it varies from 0.6 to 2 kg h-1 per person over the whole zone and seems to be more linked to the ﬁshing method used and to the degree of professionalism than to variations in the abundance of the resources surrounding the three cities. The relatively high CPUE can probably be explained by a continual immigration and/or recruitment on these ﬁshing grounds. The ﬁsh originate from sectors that are far from towns and weakly exploited. A sociological study was carried out concurrently with the ﬁshing survey and focused on present-day transformations within the ﬁshing community.},

@article{RoleConsumers,
	title = {Role as consumers},
	abstract = {Cephalopods are voracious, versatile predators. They generally have a short life span and a single spawning event followed by death. Populations are subject to dramatic fluctuations and their impact on prey populations is equally variable. The prehensile arms and tentacles of cephalopods, coupled with a highly evolved sensory system, allow them to occupy a broad trophic niche and migrations enable populations to exploit the temporal and spatial variability of production systems and populations of prey. Shoaling is a common behavioural feature of many species which facilitates prey capture and contributes to the impact of cephalopods on prey populations. Research on cephalopod stomach contents is hampered because the beak is used to bite the prey into small pieces so hard parts, which are usually needed for identification of prey species, are often rejected causing potential bias in estimation of diet. Cephalopods may also feed unnaturally in the presence of sampling gear. Despite these problems there is a growing body of data on cephalopod predation collected using direct observations, conventional visual analysis of stomach contents and serological methods. Most species feed on small crustaceans as juveniles and shift the diet to larger fish and other cephalopods during growth. This shift is accompanied by ontogenetic changes in the allometry of the brachial crown. There is increasing evidence that myctophid fishes are an important food resource for oceanic squid. The diet and stock size of some commercially exploited squid populations is sufficiently well known to quantify the impact of a single generation on the prey community. Where there is predation on commercial stocks of fish and crustaceans, the effect of cephalopod feeding on recruitment may be significant. Cephalopods are trophic opportunists in marine food webs from polar to equatorial seas.},

          The global cephalopod trade is a multi-billion-dollar industry that involves fishing and captive breeding of a dozen species of high commercial value. It also contributes wholly or partly to the income and subsistence of thousands of families around the world. Despite its broad ecological, social, and economic importance, limited research has been conducted to describe the scope and scale of the global cephalopod trade. To date, there is no specific regulation, nor have tracking systems been implemented, to study the traceability of the global cephalopod trade at an international level. We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive description of the legal trade in cephalopods to understand who the key world players in the cephalopod seafood markets are. We analysed 20 years of records compiled by the United Nations COMTRADE database. The database contained 115,108 entries for squid and cuttlefish and 71,659 entries for octopus, including the product flow between traders (countries or territories) weighted by volume (kg) and monetary value (USD). Graph theoretic analysis was used to explore the emergent properties of this database through the analysis of different measures of centrality that provide insights on the key role of the traders in the network. Our findings show that most of the market movements between ca. 250 traders are led by three countries (China, Spain, and Japan), involving 11 clusters of traders based on the volume and value of cephalopod trade and number of transactions. The most important cluster, that dominates the cephalopod seafood market, is composed by 5 Asian countries (China, India, Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam), 2 European countries (the Netherlands and Spain) and the USA. This work identifies the traders that act as major exporters and/or importers, the modulators, intermediaries or accumulators, the best-connected traders, the principal flow routes and the weaknesses of the global cephalopod trade network. This network information is essential to advance towards a transparent and sustainable cephalopods world trade.},

Yet despite its exploitation and importance in many artisanal fisheries throughout the world, little is known about its life history, ecology and vulnerability. We used stylet increment analysis to age a wild O. cyanea population for the first time and gonad histology to examine their reproductive characteristics. O. cyanea conforms to many cephalopod life history generalisations having rapid, non-asymptotic growth, a short life-span and high levels of mortality. Males were found to mature at much younger ages and sizes than females with reproductive activity concentrated in the spring and summer months. The female dominated sex-ratios in association with female brooding behaviours also suggest that larger conspicuous females may be more prone to capture and suggests that this intertidal octopus population has the potential to be negatively impacted in an unregulated fishery. Size at age and maturity comparisons between our temperate bordering population and lower latitude Tanzanian and Hawaiian populations indicated stark differences in growth rates that correlate with water temperatures. The variability in life history traits between global populations suggests that management of O. cyanea populations should be tailored to each unique set of life history characteristics and that stylet increment analysis may provide the integrity needed to accurately assess this.},

	abstract = {The problem of multi-agent learning and adaptation has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. It has been suggested that the dynamics of multi agent learning can be studied using replicator equations from population biology. Most existing studies so far have been limited to discrete strategy spaces with a small number of available actions. In many cases, however, the choices available to agents are better characterized by continuous spectra. This paper suggests a generalization of the replicator framework that allows to study the adaptive dynamics of Q-learning agents with continuous strategy spaces. Instead of probability vectors, agents’ strategies are now characterized by probability measures over continuous variables. As a result, the ordinary differential equations for the discrete case are replaced by a system of coupled integral-differential replicator equations that describe the mutual evolution of individual agent strategies. We derive a set of functional equations describing the steady state of the replicator dynamics, examine their solutions for several two-player games, and conﬁrm our analytical results using simulations.},

	abstract = {Several authors have noted that there is an under-representation of gender approaches in fisheries policy and research. While fisheries are widely considered a male-dominated industry, women play a significant and vital role in the survival of small-scale family-run fisheries and are frequently the driving force of innovation, diversification, and the development of new markets. However, these roles are often unseen – with the male fishers being the registered beneficiary and performer of more visible tasks. Although several fisheries studies have focused on gender, no study has yet considered or contextualized the impact of Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) on both the visibility and empowerment of women. Drawing on a quantitative survey of 113 FLAGs and the qualitative case study of three EU fisheries areas, this paper explores these factors. While the results show that FLAGs are active in supporting women in diversification activities, the findings highlight that their impact on women’s empowerment is complex, varies between areas, and that interventional programs play an important role in identifying gender issues in fisheries areas and how they impact their transformation and survival.},

Analysis of intra-community social stratifications in relation to participation in conservation is important to the pursuit of environmental justice as well as improved efficacy of a given con­ servation intervention. While a large body of literature broadly examines intra and inter-community dynamics in relation to community-based conservation, few have specifically quantified how wealth influences one’s participation in community-based conservation initiatives, especially in the marine realm. To address these questions, we interviewed people living near marine conservation initiatives in Madagascar. Using a principle component analysis, we created an asset-based wealth index and showed that both knowledge of and partici­ pation in marine conservation was positively correlated with wealth. Specifically, three of the four participation categories were statistically correlated with wealth, including involvement in any element of the conservation project, involvement in decision-making, and in enforcement. However, wealth was not significantly correlated with participation in monitoring. Ultimately our research highlights the importance of understanding underlying drivers of participation in community-based conservation. If the poorest in a community are underrepresented in local participation, the conservation initiative will not only be unjust, but will also likely be less effective.},

	abstract = {The sustainable use of fisheries resources is a priority of the African Union in developing the Blue Economy (BE). Growing global demand for seafood has attracted diverse actors to African waters, including Distant Water Fishing Nations (DWFNs) fleets. Complex fisheries governance challenges, unsustainable rates of fishing and rising fisheries-related crimes have ensued. To reverse these impacts, some African states are deploying various fisheries governance mechanisms. Drawing on extensive expert experiences, the review of literature, fisheries databases, international and regional agency reports, NGO and government reports and case studies from West and East Africa, we demonstrate two critical findings. First, fisheries governance mechanisms in Africa act largely to constrain small-scale fisheries (SSF) while failing to contain the industrial fisheries sector, resulting in the marginalisation of the SSF. Secondly, despite a higher incidence of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in industrial fisheries than the SSF, fisheries governance mechanisms continue to advance the ’Survival of the Richest’ – the industrial sector, to the detriment of the ’Fittest’ – the SSF. The SSF supports millions of jobs and is better adapted to meet the continents’ nutrition and socio-economic security. For the fisheries sector to contribute to the sustainable development of Africans, states must redirect governance towards regulating the industrial sector, emphasising equitable access for the SSF whilst prioritising ecological sustainability.},

	abstract = {Octopus fisheries are important at the southwest coast of Madagascar. Fishermen traditionally dried and sold octopus in the local market. Recently, an international company has developed a new lucrative market for the octopus. It has led to an increase in the value and exploitation of this species. Increase in fishing intensity has resulted in an over exploitation of the stock. The aim of this study was to find out the current situation of the fishery and the possibilities for economic improvement for the fishery. A bioeconomic model developed by Arnason was used to describe the fishery. The model has calculated the profitability of the fishery and the state of the stock. The results from the fishery indicate that actual fishing effort (no. of fishermen) is about three times more than required to earn maximum sustainable economic benefits from the octopus fishery. There is no management in place so this indicates the need of a fisheries management system. Several types of management are proposed to alleviate the fisheries and community fishing right will be likely appropriate to this fishery. This report also will study the possible implementation of this community management.},

The results show that the number and mean weight of octopus caught increased significantly after closure periods of the NTZ. However, the high intensity of fishing on the opening days reduced the potential longer term benefits of the first NTZ closure, and a
reduction in fishing pressure on the second opening lead to longer-lasting benefits.
This study demonstrates that seasonal, temporary closures of fishing sites are potentially a strong management tool in maintaining the sustainability of a traditional octopus fishery. The active participation and support of the local fishers was key to the success in the implementation and

	abstract = {Cephalopods are voracious, versatile predators. They generally have a short life span and a single spawning event followed by death. Populations are subject to dramatic fluctuations and their impact on prey populations is equally variable. The prehensile arms and tentacles of cephalopods, coupled with a highly evolved sensory system, allow them to occupy a broad trophic niche and migrations enable populations to exploit the temporal and spatial variability of production systems and populations of prey. Shoaling is a common behavioural feature of many species which facilitates prey capture and contributes to the impact of cephalopods on prey populations. Research on cephalopod stomach contents is hampered because the beak is used to bite the prey into small pieces so hard parts, which are usually needed for identification of prey species, are often rejected causing potential bias in estimation of diet. Cephalopods may also feed unnaturally in the presence of sampling gear. Despite these problems there is a growing body of data on cephalopod predation collected using direct observations, conventional visual analysis of stomach contents and serological methods. Most species feed on small crustaceans as juveniles and shift the diet to larger fish and other cephalopods during growth. This shift is accompanied by ontogenetic changes in the allometry of the brachial crown. There is increasing evidence that myctophid fishes are an important food resource for oceanic squid. The diet and stock size of some commercially exploited squid populations is sufficiently well known to quantify the impact of a single generation on the prey community. Where there is predation on commercial stocks of fish and crustaceans, the effect of cephalopod feeding on recruitment may be significant. Cephalopods are trophic opportunists in marine food webs from polar to equatorial seas.},

The success of this strategy is reduced if the released ﬁsh are temporarily invulnerable to capture due to behavioral changes, as recent research suggests. Here, we explore how temporary ﬁshing closures with short openings might be used in CR ﬁsheries to increase the catch-related utility associated with angler satisfaction from catches. We simulated generic ﬁsheries in single-lake and multiple-lake systems and found that regular, temporary closures could increase catch-related utility—but predominately under the key assumption that angler satisfaction increases disproportionately with increasing catch rates. In the multiple-lake case, a strategy of rotating temporary closures could provide greater catch-related utility than continuously open ﬁsheries, but this would depend upon anglers’ willingness to redistribute effort from closed waters to open waters. A key implication of these results is that even in CR ﬁsheries, effort limitation may be necessary to provide quality angling opportunities. Our results also emphasize the importance of understanding how vulnerable pool dynamics can differ across ﬁsheries and potentially interact with other processes and mechanisms that drive the observed changes in catchability and catch rates.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            To effectively implement an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF), managers need to consider the effects of management actions on the fishery and the ecosystem. Methods for assessing the effects on target stocks are generally well developed, but methods for assessing the effects on other components and attributes of the ecosystem are not. Area closures and effort controls are widely used fishery management tools that affect the distribution of fishing effort and may therefore have consequences for a range of species and habitats. An approach is developed to predict the effects of area closures and effort control on the biomass, production, and species richness of benthic communities in the North Sea. The redistribution of beam trawling effort as a result of management action was modelled with a random utility model, assuming that fishers selected fishing grounds on the basis of their knowledge of past catch rates. The effects of trawling on benthic invertebrates were predicted using a size-based model that accounted for differences in habitat among fishing grounds. Our simulations demonstrated that closures of different sizes and in different locations could have positive or negative effects on benthic communities. These predicted effects resulted from the trade-off between recovery in the closed areas and additional trawling effects in the open areas that arose from displaced fishing activity. In the absence of effort controls, closure of lightly fished areas had the strongest positive effect on benthic communities. Effort reduction also had a positive effect. Therefore, area closures in lightly fished areas, coupled with effort reduction, are expected to minimize the effects of fishing on benthic communities. As it was not possible to access full international data for the North Sea beam trawl fleet, the results of the analyses are illustrative rather than complete. Nevertheless, what is demonstrated is an effective approach for assessing the environmental consequences of fishery management action that can be used to inform management decision-making as part of an EAF.},

Temporal, non-permanent, rotational or periodically harvested area closures have been employed across the Indo-Paciﬁc for centuries and are a common measure within contemporary community-based and co-management frameworks. Although prior evidence suggests that periodic closures may confer ﬁsheries beneﬁts for some taxa or in certain conditions, there is little evidence that they are equally effective for the sustainable management of the many types of small-scale ﬁsheries important in the Indo-Paciﬁc. Case studies of periodic closures are reviewed to highlight the variations in target species, harvesting periodicity and ﬁshing pressure that will inﬂuence the ﬁsheries management effectiveness of this tool. Fisheries management beneﬁts are observed for short-lived, fast-growing taxa or for a range of taxa in low ﬁshing pressure situations. Stocks declines are observed for long-lived taxa or for a range of taxa if harvesting is intense. It is argued that community-based and co-management policy and action must better account for these factors when promoting and implementing periodic closures for medium- to long-term ﬁsheries management or conservation goals.},

The length of time that a closure is in place can play a determinative role in the effectiveness of the closure as a means of restoring stock biomass and diversity. For species that are slow growing and slow to reproduce, closures shorter than a decade are unlikely to be sufﬁcient for the effects of restoration to accrue. New Zealand has two legislative mechanisms speciﬁcally designed to establish temporary closures: sections 186A and 186B of the Fisheries Act 1996. These provisions were created to respond to localised depletion and to provide for the use and management practices of Māori (New Zealand’s Indigenous People). There is currently a two-year time limit on temporary closures applied for by the community. By deﬁning a time limit for temporary closures legislators have failed to account for the ecology of many of the species targeted for protection that require longer periods of protection for restoration. Furthermore, the way in which the ﬁnal decision making power is vested with central government is also inconsistent with the original purpose of the provisions. An amendment to the temporary closure provisions is suggested to provide greater ﬂexibility for users and to better recognise the non-commercial ﬁshing rights provided for by the Fisheries Act 1996, of local communities seeking to apply this tool.},

	abstract = {Marine reserves have come under criticism because of the short-term fishery losses likely to be associated with them. At the same time, marine reserves have been touted as a tool to rehabilitate depleted populations, at least for species with relatively limited adult movement. I used models to compare the short- and long-term fisheries consequences of three fishery-management tools for depleted populations. These management tools included temporary closure of the entire fishery, minimum size limits, and marine reserves. I compared them using three short-term indices: magnitude of initial drop in catches relative to those prior to new management, years until catches reached prior levels, and cumulative loss during those years. I examined a single long-term index: long-term sustainable yields. Results highlighted the potential of reserves as an efficient and effective fishery-management tool for species that will remain within reserve boundaries. Reserves created few short-term losses beyond those associated with other management measures, yet produced the highest stable catch levels. Moreover, peak catches with reserves occurred with less restriction than peak catches with other management measures. These results were consistent across two species that matured before entering the fishery but did not apply to one species that was fished while immature. In that latter case, minimum size limits produced more substantial benefits than reserves could. Nevertheless, these analyses suggest that a wide range of circumstances exist where reserves, if properly designed to minimize adult spillover while allowing abundant larval transport, can maximize fisheries harvests with a minimum of total restrictions.},

A series of natural ﬁshing experiments over this period involving marine reserves were monitored at each island, where estimates of ﬁshing intensity and selectivity were available. Fishing intensity (15\% and 25\% of biomass removed per year at Sumilon and Apo, respectively) was high enough to aﬀect total community biomass, but not density, signiﬁcantly. Species richness was not aﬀected signiﬁcantly by ﬁshing, except at Sumilon reserve. The ﬁshery was relatively non-selective with most families/trophic groups caught roughly in proportion to their contribution to community biomass. Thus ﬁshing did not alter the relative abundance of the major families/trophic groups signiﬁcantly, except during a period of use of explosives and drive nets in the Sumilon reserve. At the level of family/trophic group the community displayed strong resilience of structure. There was little evidence of secondary eﬀects e.g. declines in abundance of large predators resulting in measurable increases in abundance of their prey. This resilience of the community to the eﬀects of ﬁshing most likely results from three important community attributes (open nature of the component populations, likely maintenance of upstream recruitment supply and apparent lack of any obvious ‘‘keystone’’ species or families) and one important characteristic of the ﬁshery (relatively non-selective with respect to the components of the community).},

	abstract = {Octopuses are a difﬁcult resource to manage due to their short life span, rapid growth, high natural mortality and sensitivity to environmental conditions. These biological traits result in seasonal ﬂuctuations in abundance and subsequent landings. Twenty two octopus ﬁsheries were reviewed from 17 countries to examine the application and effectiveness of different management measures for consideration in the Tasmanian Octopus pallidus ﬁshery in Australia. While the most commonly used measures in these ﬁsheries were input controls, particularly seasonal closures and minimum size limits, these controls are poorly suited to semelparous, holobenthic octopuses such as Octopus pallidus. A semelparous reproductive strategy means that minimum size limits don't allow animals to reproduce prior to capture. A holobenthic life history strategy means that ﬁshery-wide seasonal closures are unable to address variation in biological characteristics (e.g. size at maturity) across sub-stocks and collectively reduce effort on vulnerable life stages. Seasonal closures and minimum size limits also reduce the economic efﬁciency of the ﬂeet and may diminish ﬁshery productivity through effort displacement and serial depletion. A rotational system of effort or cap on total effort that provides ﬂexibility to ﬁshers and effectively spreads ﬁshing effort, allowing different areas or sub-stocks to recover, could be a more effective option for achieving the objectives of most octopus ﬁsheries.},

Aquaculture is currently the fastest-growing food production sector globally and a sustainable option for attaining food security. Food as a basic necessity for man’s survival is always a timely issue. Hence, owing to aquaculture’s unique role, it is expected that the demand for aquatic products (especially seafood) will continue to increase due to geometric population growth. Many seafood products are among the critical protein sources in the world. This is partly because they have micronutrients and essential fatty acids that are not present in land-based protein sources. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, shellﬁsh is one of the main cultured aquaculture groups in the world. Hence, the development of shellﬁsh aquaculture has an important role in sustainable food supply and food security. In this article, an overview of the current and projected contributions of shellﬁsh aquaculture to global food security is presented. Apparently, shellﬁsh aquaculture in the next few decades will have to be intensiﬁed to bridge the gap between demand and supply in a cost-effective manner. Also, food waste would have to be reduced and natural resources should be used more efﬁciently to minimize the negative impacts on aquaculture on the environment.},

Nowadays, there are discrepancies on the processes to include in that budget, how to estimate them, and which scale should be applied, from individual to ecosystem. Site-speciﬁc environmental conditions and culture methods also affect signiﬁcantly the estimates. Here, we have gathered environmental, biochemical and metabolic data from published scientiﬁc articles, reports and existing databases to present the metabolic CO2 budget for mussel aquaculture in the coastal inlets of the Northwest Iberian upwelling. We analyse the contribution of mussel ﬂesh and shell production jointly and separately. At the individual scale, the shell CO2 budget is estimated from CO2 removal by shell matrix protein synthesis and CO2 release during calciﬁcation and respiration to support shell maintenance. Organic carbon in mussel ﬂesh and CO2 released by respiration to support ﬂesh maintenance contribute to the ﬂesh CO2 budget. Only calciﬁcation and respiration processes are considered when estimating the metabolic carbon footprint of individual mussels because organic carbon in mussel ﬂesh and shell returns to the atmosphere as CO2 in a relatively short period. While the metabolic carbon footprint associated to mussel shell remains constant at 365 kg CO2 per ton of shell, it varies from 92 to 578 kg CO2 per ton of mussel ﬂesh. This large variability depends on mussel seeding time and harvesting size, due to the differential seasonal growth patterns of ﬂesh and shell. Inclusion of the CO2 potentially immobilised in mussel faeces buried in the sediments would lead to a reduction of the metabolic carbon footprint estimates by up to 6 \% compared with the individual estimates.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is a critical food source for the world’s growing population, producing 52\% of the aquatic animal products consumed. Marine aquaculture (mariculture) generates 37.5\% of this production and 97\% of the world’s seaweed harvest. Mariculture products may offer a climate-friendly, high-protein food source, because they often have lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emission footprints than do the equivalent products farmed on land. However, sustainable intensification of low-emissions mariculture is key to maintaining a low GHG footprint as production scales up to meet future demand. We examine the major GHG sources and carbon sinks associated with fed finfish, macroalgae and bivalve mariculture, and the factors influencing variability across sectors. We highlight knowledge gaps and provide recommendations for GHG emissions reductions and carbon storage, including accounting for interactions between mariculture operations and surrounding marine ecosystems. By linking the provision of maricultured products to GHG abatement opportunities, we can advance climate-friendly practices that generate sustainable environmental, social, and economic outcomes.},

	abstract = {Mangrove forests are remarkably diverse and productive ecosystems, with distinctive biophysical environments in intertidal coastal regions of the tropics and subtropics. In these regions, shrimp cultivation is identified as a profitable business and one of the main reasons for clearing of mangroves to construct shrimp farms. Against this backdrop and based on the first author's previous PhD research and other relevant scholarly works, in this commentary we discuss the aspects and contexts of the mangrove-based integrated shrimp farming system. Then, we recommend a model of co-management and a set of policy option towards sustainable silvo-aquaculture to protect/restore the mangrove forests and sustain shrimp production in coastal areas of Bangladesh. Mangroves and shrimp culture are not necessarily incompatible. Many mangrove species have been identified as beneficial for shrimp culture for a number of possible reasons. Most importantly, the nutrients in the leaf litter of several mangrove species have been found to enhance natural food production for shrimp. Besides the nutrient input, the leaf litter also provides surface area for biofilm development, on which different life stages of shrimp can graze. In addition, the combination of mangrove leaf litter and feed has been shown to enhance shrimp production synergistically. Additional economic benefits from mangrove-shrimp co-management include the production of timber (e.g. buildings, boats and fuel woods) and non-timber products (e.g. fruits, honey, fibers, firewood, resins and bark). Thus, mangrove-based aquaculture or silvo-aquaculture system can be considered as a nature-based solution to sustainably revitalize the economy in coastal areas where shrimp has been the economic mainstay. Though there are positive effects, we point out some potential negative impacts of mangrove-based shrimp culture, like the anti-nutrients content in the leaf litter, which might impact shrimp production. In addition, the long term use of mangrove leaf litter might degrade the water quality. Therefore, the co-management policy recommends a controlled practice of mangroves in shrimp culture to balance conservation of mangrove-based ecology and profitable shrimp production. The approach promotes nature-based solutions and fosters sustain­ able pathways for food production, considering socio-economic and environmental dynamics.},

With projected rapid continual growth in the sector, if left unmanaged, aquaculture pollution can have detrimental environmental and social implications. Using the DPSIR framework, the paper examines current practices and pathways of plastic pollution from marine aquaculture in the NE-Atlantic, drawing on findings from literature, stakeholder consultations and beach litter assessments. Pathways for aquaculture-related litter identified include rough weather, farmer behavior, inadequate access to recycling facilities, low price of consumable plastics and high cost of recycling. Beach litter analyses conducted as part of the study exposed serious issues of under quantification, resulting from difficulties in source identification and a lack of detailed categorization in official monitoring systems. The paper makes recommendations to improve litter quantification and waste management, including the use of local knowledge and experts to identify sources of marine litter.},

Countermeasures against pharmaceuticals pollution in aquaculture were addressed including rules released by the Chinese government (e.g., the Ministry of Agriculture). Issues on ecological prevention, vaccination prevention, drug prevention in aquaculture were further discussed.

Sea cages are the dominant production system for the on-growing stage of salmon farming. It represents an effective production system with lower investment and running costs than land-based systems. The development and improvement of the sea cage farming system has been one of the most important factors for the growth of the salmon farming industry. However, during recent years certain problems related to their placement in the open marine environment have proved highly challenging, increasing operating costs and impacting on industry public relations. The problems are mainly due to parasites, diseases and escape of ﬁsh. In this article, emerging technical solutions for solving those problems are described.},

	abstract = {The enhancement of salmon populations has long been used to increase the abundance of salmon returning to spawn and/ or to be captured in fisheries. However, in some instances enhancement can have adverse impacts on adjacent nonenhanced populations. In Canada’s Skeena watershed, smolt-to-adult survival of Babine Lake sockeye from 1962–2002 was inversely related to the abundance of sockeye smolts leaving Babine Lake. This relationship has led to the concern that Babine Lake smolt production, which is primarily enhanced by spawning channels, may depress wild Skeena (Babine and non-Babine) sockeye populations as a result of increased competition between wild and enhanced sockeye smolts as they leave their natal lakes and co-migrate to sea. To test this hypothesis we used data on Skeena sockeye populations and oceanographic conditions to statistically examine the relationship between Skeena sockeye productivity (adult salmon produced per spawner) and an index of Babine Lake enhanced smolt abundance while accounting for the potential influence of early marine conditions. While we had relatively high power to detect large effects, we did not find support for the hypothesis that the productivity of wild Skeena sockeye is inversely related to the abundance of enhanced sockeye smolts leaving Babine Lake in a given year. Importantly, life-time productivity of Skeena sockeye is only partially explained by marine survival, and likely is an unreliable measure of the influence of smolt abundance. Limitations to our analyses, which include: (1) the reliance upon adult salmon produced per spawner (rather than per smolt) as an index of marine survival, and (2) incomplete age structure for most of the populations considered, highlight uncertainties that should be addressed if understanding relationships between wild and enhanced sockeye is a priority in the Skeena.},

	abstract = {Carbonate hardparts of marine organisms are frequently explored archives of their ambient seawater composi­ tion. Among the various materials used, the hardparts of molluscs are particularly relevant because their accretionary growth allows for the compilation of time-resolved proxy data sets. Here, we explore to which extent the calcium isotope values of aragonitic cephalopod hardparts represent proxies for seawater composition or record a trophic level signal. In a first step, we collect Ca isotope data from a diverse set of modern cepha­ lopods, including Nautilus, Sepia and Spirula. These taxa differ in their external/internal hardparts, life spans, trophic levels, habitat depth, hinterland geology, and resulting runoff. In a second step, we have put these concepts to the test and explore the calcium isotope signatures of Lower Cretaceous (lower Albian) wellpreserved cephalopods (nautiloids, ammonoids and belemnites) and bivalve shells from Madagascar. In the sense of a methodological comparison, two measurement approaches (double spike (δ44/40Ca, TIMS) and bracketing standard (δ44/42Ca, MC-ICP-MS) techniques are applied. Calcium from organic matter and intra-shell variations on bulk δ44/40Ca isotope values are explored. Four protocols (H2O2, NaOH, HClO4, incineration up to 250 ◦C including subsequent rinsing with deionised water and Ca removal) are applied to destroy organic matter in the shell material and to dissolve any non‑carbonate bound Ca, i.e., its metastable secondary Ca reservoir. These are equally successful, and the Ca isotope values of the purified carbonate phase plot on the equilibrium mass fractionation line. Samples not treated to destroy or remove their organic matter do not fall on the equi­ librium mass fractionation line. Limitations of sample pre-treatment are reflected by a slight shift towards lower values in the case of incineration experiments at 650 ◦C. This feature is best explained in the context of a mineralogical phase transformation of aragonite to calcite. Calcium isotope values show no significant variability when sampling hardparts with different microstructures (callus, nacre, prismatic layer) and mineralised during different ontogenetic phases (outer shell, septa). Perhaps most relevant, mean δ44/40Ca (‰ SRM-915a) isotope values for Nautilus (0.72‰ ±0.19 2SD), Sepia (0.79‰ ±0.18 2SD), and Spirula (0.50‰ ±0.18 2SD) lack evidence for a significant control by trophic levels. Nitrogen isotope data and known diets for all three cephalopods serve as a litmus test for these data, which do not correlate with this dietary proxy information. These results are considered encouraging and suggest that Ca isotope values of cephalopod shells are proxies for their ambient seawater Ca isotope signatures. According to our data, however, it remains unclear to which extend cephalopod hardparts record the Ca isotopic composition of past seawater. Specifically, the data from three different modern species point to a mean Δ44/40Ca(ceph-seawater) fractionation of − 1.21‰ (± 0.15 2SD).

A time-variant, stage-classified, matrix population model was developed to interpret the seasonal variation of octopus stage densities and to estimate several life cycle parameters. An annual and a semi-annual periodic cycle were found in the stage densities. A main peak of benthic settlement was observed during summer and a secondary, irregular one during late autumn. Two spawning peaks were estimated, a main one during late winter–spring and a secondary one during late summer–early autumn. More than 50\% of the just-settled individuals will eventually die after 3 months. Mortality rate declines, as individuals grow larger, reaches a minimum approximately 6 months after settlement, and then grows again probably because of terminal spawning. The life expectancy of recently settled individuals ({\textless}50 g) during their summer peak is approximately 5 months. The lifespan of the common octopus is estimated to be between 12 and 15 months. The octopuses' mean specific growth rates (±s.d.) in their natural environment were 1.61 ± 0.30 d−1 for 50–200 g individuals and 1.19 ± 0.31 d−1 for 200–500 g individuals.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships among the squids and cuttlefishes (Cephalopoda:Decapodiformes) have resisted clarification for decades, despite multiple analyses of morphological, molecular and combined data sets. More recently, analyses of complete mitochondrial genomes and hundreds of nuclear loci have yielded similarly ambiguous results. In this study, we re-evaluate hypotheses of decapodiform relationships by increasing taxo­ nomic breadth and utilizing higher-quality genome and transcriptome data for several taxa. We also employ analytical approaches to (1) identify contamination in transcriptome data, (2) better assess model adequacy, and (3) account for potential biases. Using this larger data set, we consistently recover a clade comprising Myopsida (closed-eye squid), Sepiida (cuttlefishes), and Oegopsida (open-eye squid) that is sister to a Sepiolida (bobtail and bottletail squid) clade. Idiosepiida (pygmy squid) is consistently recovered as the sister group to all sampled decapodiform lineages. Further, a weighted Shimodaira-Hasegawa test applied to one of our larger data matrices rejects all alternatives to these ordinal-level relationships. At present, available nuclear genome-scale data support nested clades of relatively large-bodied decapodiform cephalopods to the exclusion of pygmy squids, but improved taxon sampling and additional genomic data will be needed to test these novel hypotheses rigorously.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships among the squids and cuttlefishes (Cephalopoda:Decapodiformes) have resisted clarification for decades, despite multiple analyses of morphological, molecular and combined data sets. More recently, analyses of complete mitochondrial genomes and hundreds of nuclear loci have yielded similarly ambiguous results. In this study, we re-evaluate hypotheses of decapodiform relationships by increasing taxo­ nomic breadth and utilizing higher-quality genome and transcriptome data for several taxa. We also employ analytical approaches to (1) identify contamination in transcriptome data, (2) better assess model adequacy, and (3) account for potential biases. Using this larger data set, we consistently recover a clade comprising Myopsida (closed-eye squid), Sepiida (cuttlefishes), and Oegopsida (open-eye squid) that is sister to a Sepiolida (bobtail and bottletail squid) clade. Idiosepiida (pygmy squid) is consistently recovered as the sister group to all sampled decapodiform lineages. Further, a weighted Shimodaira-Hasegawa test applied to one of our larger data matrices rejects all alternatives to these ordinal-level relationships. At present, available nuclear genome-scale data support nested clades of relatively large-bodied decapodiform cephalopods to the exclusion of pygmy squids, but improved taxon sampling and additional genomic data will be needed to test these novel hypotheses rigorously.},

Despite discursive and institutional shifts toward more “collaborative” and “community-based” conservation programing, there is a deficiency of women’s nominal as well as effective participation in community management organizations. This research shows that conservation organizations’ focus on proximate drivers of marine resource use, or a politics of picking the “low-hanging fruit,” over ultimate drivers such as global commodity chains, places disproportionate emphasis on marine spatial enclosures and restricting specific, and gendered, harvest methods. To address gender bias concerning access to and control over natural resources, we must go beyond the rhetoric of “community involvement” to address gendered inequalities in conservation decision making, and whose interests are served by conservation projects.},

We present an analysis of the O. cyanea catch data for the first two years of temporary closures based on landings data collected from village-based octopus collectors. We found a significant closure effect in terms of total weight and number of octopus caught on opening days, but observed that these benefits dissipated quickly, returning to pre-closure levels within days. Mean octopus size increased by 41\% on average when compared to data from selected control sites. However, extremely high levels of fishing effort on opening days meant that these biological effects did not translate into increased weight of octopus caught per successful fisher over the opening tide. Upon opening of concurrent closures during the second round of closures we found significant increases in the weight of octopus caught per successful fisher. We conclude that the pilot closures had a significant closure effect, but caution against isolated openings leading to concentrated fishing effort on opening days.},

	abstract = {The market demand for octopus grows each year, but landings are decreasing, and prices are rising. The present study investigated (1) diversity of Octopodidae in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) and (2) connectivity and genetic structure of Octopus cyanea and O. vulgaris populations in order to obtain baseline data for management plans. A fragment of the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene was sequenced in 275 octopus individuals from Madagascar, Kenya and Tanzania. In addition, 41 sequences of O. vulgaris from South Africa, Brazil, Amsterdam Island, Tristan da Cunha, Senegal and Galicia were retrieved from databases and included in this study. Five different species were identified using DNA barcoding, with first records for O. oliveri and Callistoctopus luteus in the WIO. For O. cyanea (n = 229, 563 bp), 22 haplotypes were found, forming one haplogroup. AMOVA revealed shallow but significant genetic population structure among all sites (ϕST = 0.025, p = 0.02), with significant differentiation among: (1) Kanamai, (2) southern Kenya, Tanzania, North and West Madagascar, (3) Southwest Madagascar and (4) East Madagascar (ϕCT = 0.035, p = 0.017). For O. vulgaris (n = 71, 482 bp), 15 haplotypes were identified, forming three haplogroups. A significant genetic population structure was found among all sites (ϕST = 0.82, p � 0.01). Based on pairwise ϕST-values and hierarchical AMOVAs, populations of O. vulgaris could be grouped as follows: (1) Brazil, (2) Madagascar and (3) all other sites.

The present study investigated (1) diversity of Octopodidae in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) and (2) connectivity and genetic structure of Octopus cyanea and O. vulgaris populations in order to obtain baseline data for management plans. A fragment of the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene was sequenced in 275 octopus individuals from Madagascar, Kenya and Tanzania. In addition, 41 sequences of O. vulgaris from South Africa, Brazil, Amsterdam Island, Tristan da Cunha, Senegal and Galicia were retrieved from databases and included in this study. Five different species were identified using DNA barcoding, with first records for O. oliveri and Callistoctopus luteus in the WIO. For O. cyanea (n = 229, 563 bp), 22 haplotypes were found, forming one haplogroup. AMOVA revealed shallow but significant genetic population structure among all sites (ϕST = 0.025, p = 0.02), with significant differentiation among: (1) Kanamai, (2) southern Kenya, Tanzania, North and West Madagascar, (3) Southwest Madagascar and (4) East Madagascar (ϕCT = 0.035, p = 0.017). For O. vulgaris (n = 71, 482 bp), 15 haplotypes were identified, forming three haplogroups. A significant genetic population structure was found among all sites (ϕST = 0.82, p � 0.01). Based on pairwise ϕST-values and hierarchical AMOVAs, populations of O. vulgaris could be grouped as follows: (1) Brazil, (2) Madagascar and (3) all other sites.

	abstract = {The Mozambique Channel region in East Africa has diverse marine ecosystems and serves as a migratory corridor for economically important species. Local and foreign industrial fisheries operate in the Mozambique Channel, but regional small-scale fisheries are the crucially important fisheries that provide food security, livelihoods, and economic opportunities for rural coastal communities. This study reconstructed and investigated trends in the fishing effort and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of small-scale marine fisheries in four Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) that constitute the Mozambique Channel, i.e., Union of Comoros, Madagascar, Mayotte, and Mozambique, from 1950 to 2016. Effective fishing effort for small-scale fisheries in the form of fishing capacity in kWdays (i.e., kilowatt days) was derived using the number, length, motorization (engine power) by fishing vessels, as well as an approximate human-powered equivalent for shore-based fishers without vessels, as well as days of fishing per year. Effective small-scale fishing effort in the Mozambique Channel increased by nearly 60 times from just over 386,000 kWdays in 1950 to over 23 million kWdays in 2016. Correspondingly, the overall small-scale CPUE, based on previously and independently reconstructed catch data declined by 91\% in the region as a whole, from just under 175 kg⋅kWday –1 in the early 1950s to just over 15 kg⋅kWday –1 in recent years. All four EEZs showed the strongest declines in the small-scale CPUE in the earlier decades, driven by motorization and growth in vessel numbers impacting effective fishing effort. Increased motorization combined with a substantial growth in overall vessel numbers were the drivers of the increasing fishing effort and decreasing CPUE, and clearly suggest that continuing to increase the fishing capacity of small-scale fisheries in the absence of effective and restrictive management actions may exacerbate overexploitation risk.},

@article{RoleConsumers,
	title = {Role as consumers},
	abstract = {Cephalopods are voracious, versatile predators. They generally have a short life span and a single spawning event followed by death. Populations are subject to dramatic fluctuations and their impact on prey populations is equally variable. The prehensile arms and tentacles of cephalopods, coupled with a highly evolved sensory system, allow them to occupy a broad trophic niche and migrations enable populations to exploit the temporal and spatial variability of production systems and populations of prey. Shoaling is a common behavioural feature of many species which facilitates prey capture and contributes to the impact of cephalopods on prey populations. Research on cephalopod stomach contents is hampered because the beak is used to bite the prey into small pieces so hard parts, which are usually needed for identification of prey species, are often rejected causing potential bias in estimation of diet. Cephalopods may also feed unnaturally in the presence of sampling gear. Despite these problems there is a growing body of data on cephalopod predation collected using direct observations, conventional visual analysis of stomach contents and serological methods. Most species feed on small crustaceans as juveniles and shift the diet to larger fish and other cephalopods during growth. This shift is accompanied by ontogenetic changes in the allometry of the brachial crown. There is increasing evidence that myctophid fishes are an important food resource for oceanic squid. The diet and stock size of some commercially exploited squid populations is sufficiently well known to quantify the impact of a single generation on the prey community. Where there is predation on commercial stocks of fish and crustaceans, the effect of cephalopod feeding on recruitment may be significant. Cephalopods are trophic opportunists in marine food webs from polar to equatorial seas.},

	abstract = {Cephalopods are voracious, versatile predators. They generally have a short life span and a single spawning event followed by death. Populations are subject to dramatic fluctuations and their impact on prey populations is equally variable. The prehensile arms and tentacles of cephalopods, coupled with a highly evolved sensory system, allow them to occupy a broad trophic niche and migrations enable populations to exploit the temporal and spatial variability of production systems and populations of prey. Shoaling is a common behavioural feature of many species which facilitates prey capture and contributes to the impact of cephalopods on prey populations. Research on cephalopod stomach contents is hampered because the beak is used to bite the prey into small pieces so hard parts, which are usually needed for identification of prey species, are often rejected causing potential bias in estimation of diet. Cephalopods may also feed unnaturally in the presence of sampling gear. Despite these problems there is a growing body of data on cephalopod predation collected using direct observations, conventional visual analysis of stomach contents and serological methods. Most species feed on small crustaceans as juveniles and shift the diet to larger fish and other cephalopods during growth. This shift is accompanied by ontogenetic changes in the allometry of the brachial crown. There is increasing evidence that myctophid fishes are an important food resource for oceanic squid. The diet and stock size of some commercially exploited squid populations is sufficiently well known to quantify the impact of a single generation on the prey community. Where there is predation on commercial stocks of fish and crustaceans, the effect of cephalopod feeding on recruitment may be significant.

It also contributes wholly or partly to the income and subsistence of thousands of families around the world. Despite its broad ecological, social, and economic importance, limited research has been conducted to describe the scope and scale of the global cephalopod trade. To date, there is no specific regulation, nor have tracking systems been implemented, to study the traceability of the global cephalopod trade at an international level. We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive description of the legal trade in cephalopods to understand who the key world players in the cephalopod seafood markets are. We analysed 20 years of records compiled by the United Nations COMTRADE database. The database contained 115,108 entries for squid and cuttlefish and 71,659 entries for octopus, including the product flow between traders (countries or territories) weighted by volume (kg) and monetary value (USD). Graph theoretic analysis was used to explore the emergent properties of this database through the analysis of different measures of centrality that provide insights on the key role of the traders in the network. Our findings show that most of the market movements between ca. 250 traders are led by three countries (China, Spain, and Japan), involving 11 clusters of traders based on the volume and value of cephalopod trade and number of transactions. The most important cluster, that dominates the cephalopod seafood market, is composed by 5 Asian countries (China, India, Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam), 2 European countries (the Netherlands and Spain) and the USA. This work identifies the traders that act as major exporters and/or importers, the modulators, intermediaries or accumulators, the best-connected traders, the principal flow routes and the weaknesses of the global cephalopod trade network.

	abstract = {Octopus cyanea is taken as an unregulated, recreationally fished species from the intertidal reefs of Ningaloo, Western Australia. Yet despite its exploitation and importance in many artisanal fisheries throughout the world, little is known about its life history, ecology and vulnerability. We used stylet increment analysis to age a wild O. cyanea population for the first time and gonad histology to examine their reproductive characteristics. O. cyanea conforms to many cephalopod life history generalisations having rapid, non-asymptotic growth, a short life-span and high levels of mortality. Males were found to mature at much younger ages and sizes than females with reproductive activity concentrated in the spring and summer months. The female dominated sex-ratios in association with female brooding behaviours also suggest that larger conspicuous females may be more prone to capture and suggests that this intertidal octopus population has the potential to be negatively impacted in an unregulated fishery. Size at age and maturity comparisons between our temperate bordering population and lower latitude Tanzanian and Hawaiian populations indicated stark differences in growth rates that correlate with water temperatures. The variability in life history traits between global populations suggests that management of O. cyanea populations should be tailored to each unique set of life history characteristics and that stylet increment analysis may provide the integrity needed to accurately assess this.},

	abstract = {Several authors have noted that there is an under-representation of gender approaches in fisheries policy and research. While fisheries are widely considered a male-dominated industry, women play a significant and vital role in the survival of small-scale family-run fisheries and are frequently the driving force of innovation, diversification, and the development of new markets. However, these roles are often unseen – with the male fishers being the registered beneficiary and performer of more visible tasks. Although several fisheries studies have focused on gender, no study has yet considered or contextualized the impact of Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) on both the visibility and empowerment of women. Drawing on a quantitative survey of 113 FLAGs and the qualitative case study of three EU fisheries areas, this paper explores these factors. While the results show that FLAGs are active in supporting women in diversification activities, the findings highlight that their impact on women’s empowerment is complex, varies between areas, and that interventional programs play an important role in identifying gender issues in fisheries areas and how they impact their transformation and survival.},

	abstract = {Conservation organizations often adopt the normative value of “whole community” participation, predicated on the idea that broad community involvement across categories of identity and social stratification will lead to more successful project outcomes. Analysis of intra-community social stratifications in relation to participation in conservation is important to the pursuit of environmental justice as well as improved efficacy of a given con­ servation intervention. While a large body of literature broadly examines intra and inter-community dynamics in relation to community-based conservation, few have specifically quantified how wealth influences one’s participation in community-based conservation initiatives, especially in the marine realm. To address these questions, we interviewed people living near marine conservation initiatives in Madagascar. Using a principle component analysis, we created an asset-based wealth index and showed that both knowledge of and partici­ pation in marine conservation was positively correlated with wealth. Specifically, three of the four participation categories were statistically correlated with wealth, including involvement in any element of the conservation project, involvement in decision-making, and in enforcement. However, wealth was not significantly correlated with participation in monitoring. Ultimately our research highlights the importance of understanding underlying drivers of participation in community-based conservation. If the poorest in a community are underrepresented in local participation, the conservation initiative will not only be unjust, but will also likely be less effective.},

	abstract = {Octopus fisheries are important at the southwest coast of Madagascar. Fishermen traditionally dried and sold octopus in the local market. Recently, an international company has developed a new lucrative market for the octopus. It has led to an increase in the value and exploitation of this species. Increase in fishing intensity has resulted in an over exploitation of the stock. The aim of this study was to find out the current situation of the fishery and the possibilities for economic improvement for the fishery. A bioeconomic model developed by Arnason was used to describe the fishery. The model has calculated the profitability of the fishery and the state of the stock. The results from the fishery indicate that actual fishing effort (no. of fishermen) is about three times more than required to earn maximum sustainable economic benefits from the octopus fishery. There is no management in place so this indicates the need of a fisheries management system. Several types of management are proposed to alleviate the fisheries and community fishing right will be likely appropriate to this fishery. This report also will study the possible implementation of this community management.},

	abstract = {The sustainable use of fisheries resources is a priority of the African Union in developing the Blue Economy (BE). Growing global demand for seafood has attracted diverse actors to African waters, including Distant Water Fishing Nations (DWFNs) fleets. Complex fisheries governance challenges, unsustainable rates of fishing and rising fisheries-related crimes have ensued. To reverse these impacts, some African states are deploying various fisheries governance mechanisms. Drawing on extensive expert experiences, the review of literature, fisheries databases, international and regional agency reports, NGO and government reports and case studies from West and East Africa, we demonstrate two critical findings. First, fisheries governance mechanisms in Africa act largely to constrain small-scale fisheries (SSF) while failing to contain the industrial fisheries sector, resulting in the marginalisation of the SSF. Secondly, despite a higher incidence of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in industrial fisheries than the SSF, fisheries governance mechanisms continue to advance the ’Survival of the Richest’ – the industrial sector, to the detriment of the ’Fittest’ – the SSF. The SSF supports millions of jobs and is better adapted to meet the continents’ nutrition and socio-economic security. For the fisheries sector to contribute to the sustainable development of Africans, states must redirect governance towards regulating the industrial sector, emphasising equitable access for the SSF whilst prioritising ecological sustainability.},

Despite these problems there is a growing body of data on cephalopod predation collected using direct observations, conventional visual analysis of stomach contents and serological methods.

This shift is accompanied by ontogenetic changes in the allometry of the brachial crown. There is increasing evidence that myctophid fishes are an important food resource for oceanic squid. The diet and stock size of some commercially exploited squid populations is sufficiently well known to quantify the impact of a single generation on the prey community.

The ﬁeld study we conducted in Madagascar in 1999 and 2000 showed that the results achieved by this program vary signiﬁcantly from one level of action to another. In particular, the ICM process seems to be more difﬁcult to initiate at the regional level. This paper presents the observations leading to this diagnostic, and enlightens some fundamental mechanisms that can explain it. General recommendations are formulated in relation to this case study. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here, the results of the first two closures of an octopus No-Take Zone (NTZ) in the region, based on fisheries data collected between September 2003 and June 2006 are presented. The results show that the number and mean weight of octopus caught increased significantly after closure periods of the NTZ. However, the high intensity of fishing on the opening days reduced the potential longer term benefits of the first NTZ closure, and a reduction in fishing pressure on the second opening lead to longer-lasting benefits. This study demonstrates that seasonal, temporary closures of fishing sites are potentially a strong management tool in maintaining the sustainability of a traditional octopus fishery. The active participation and support of the local fishers was key to the success in the implementation and respect of the NTZ.},

	abstract = {Cephalopods are voracious, versatile predators. They generally have a short life span and a single spawning event followed by death. Populations are subject to dramatic fluctuations and their impact on prey populations is equally variable. The prehensile arms and tentacles of cephalopods, coupled with a highly evolved sensory system, allow them to occupy a broad trophic niche and migrations enable populations to exploit the temporal and spatial variability of production systems and populations of prey. Shoaling is a common behavioural feature of many species which facilitates prey capture and contributes to the impact of cephalopods on prey populations. Research on cephalopod stomach contents is hampered because the beak is used to bite the prey into small pieces so hard parts, which are usually needed for identification of prey species, are often rejected causing potential bias in estimation of diet. Cephalopods may also feed unnaturally in the presence of sampling gear. Despite these problems there is a growing body of data on cephalopod predation collected using direct observations, conventional visual analysis of stomach contents and serological methods. Most species feed on small crustaceans as juveniles and shift the diet to larger fish and other cephalopods during growth. This shift is accompanied by ontogenetic changes in the allometry of the brachial crown. There is increasing evidence that myctophid fishes are an important food resource for oceanic squid. The diet and stock size of some commercially exploited squid populations is sufficiently well known to quantify the impact of a single generation on the prey community. Where there is predation on commercial stocks of fish and crustaceans, the effect of cephalopod feeding on recruitment may be significant. Cephalopods are trophic opportunists in marine food webs from polar to equatorial seas.},

Methods for assessing the effects on target stocks are generally well developed, but methods for assessing the effects on other components and attributes of the ecosystem are not. Area closures and effort controls are widely used fishery management tools that affect the distribution of fishing effort and may therefore have consequences for a range of species and habitats. An approach is developed to predict the effects of area closures and effort control on the biomass, production, and species richness of benthic communities in the North Sea. The redistribution of beam trawling effort as a result of management action was modelled with a random utility model, assuming that fishers selected fishing grounds on the basis of their knowledge of past catch rates. The effects of trawling on benthic invertebrates were predicted using a size-based model that accounted for differences in habitat among fishing grounds. Our simulations demonstrated that closures of different sizes and in different locations could have positive or negative effects on benthic communities. These predicted effects resulted from the trade-off between recovery in the closed areas and additional trawling effects in the open areas that arose from displaced fishing activity. In the absence of effort controls, closure of lightly fished areas had the strongest positive effect on benthic communities. Effort reduction also had a positive effect. Therefore, area closures in lightly fished areas, coupled with effort reduction, are expected to minimize the effects of fishing on benthic communities. As it was not possible to access full international data for the North Sea beam trawl fleet, the results of the analyses are illustrative rather than complete.

	abstract = {Marine reserves have come under criticism because of the short-term fishery losses likely to be associated with them. At the same time, marine reserves have been touted as a tool to rehabilitate depleted populations, at least for species with relatively limited adult movement. I used models to compare the short- and long-term fisheries consequences of three fishery-management tools for depleted populations. These management tools included temporary closure of the entire fishery, minimum size limits, and marine reserves. I compared them using three short-term indices: magnitude of initial drop in catches relative to those prior to new management, years until catches reached prior levels, and cumulative loss during those years. I examined a single long-term index: long-term sustainable yields. Results highlighted the potential of reserves as an efficient and effective fishery-management tool for species that will remain within reserve boundaries. Reserves created few short-term losses beyond those associated with other management measures, yet produced the highest stable catch levels. Moreover, peak catches with reserves occurred with less restriction than peak catches with other management measures. These results were consistent across two species that matured before entering the fishery but did not apply to one species that was fished while immature. In that latter case, minimum size limits produced more substantial benefits than reserves could. Nevertheless, these analyses suggest that a wide range of circumstances exist where reserves, if properly designed to minimize adult spillover while allowing abundant larval transport, can maximize fisheries harvests with a minimum of total restrictions.},

	abstract = {Abstract To effectively implement an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF), managers need to consider the effects of management actions on the fishery and the ecosystem. Methods for assessing the effects on target stocks are generally well developed, but methods for assessing the effects on other components and attributes of the ecosystem are not. Area closures and effort controls are widely used fishery management tools that affect the distribution of fishing effort and may therefore have consequences for a range of species and habitats. An approach is developed to predict the effects of area closures and effort control on the biomass, production, and species richness of benthic communities in the North Sea. The redistribution of beam trawling effort as a result of management action was modelled with a random utility model, assuming that fishers selected fishing grounds on the basis of their knowledge of past catch rates. The effects of trawling on benthic invertebrates were predicted using a size-based model that accounted for differences in habitat among fishing grounds. Our simulations demonstrated that closures of different sizes and in different locations could have positive or negative effects on benthic communities. These predicted effects resulted from the trade-off between recovery in the closed areas and additional trawling effects in the open areas that arose from displaced fishing activity. In the absence of effort controls, closure of lightly fished areas had the strongest positive effect on benthic communities. Effort reduction also had a positive effect. Therefore, area closures in lightly fished areas, coupled with effort reduction, are expected to minimize the effects of fishing on benthic communities. As it was not possible to access full international data for the North Sea beam trawl fleet, the results of the analyses are illustrative rather than complete. Nevertheless, what is demonstrated is an effective approach for assessing the environmental consequences of fishery management action that can be used to inform management decision-making as part of an EAF.},

At the same time, marine reserves have been touted as a tool to rehabilitate depleted populations, at least for species with relatively limited adult movement. I used models to compare the short- and long-term fisheries consequences of three fishery-management tools for depleted populations. These management tools included temporary closure of the entire fishery, minimum size limits, and marine reserves. I compared them using three short-term indices: magnitude of initial drop in catches relative to those prior to new management, years until catches reached prior levels, and cumulative loss during those years. I examined a single long-term index: long-term sustainable yields. Results highlighted the potential of reserves as an efficient and effective fishery-management tool for species that will remain within reserve boundaries. Reserves created few short-term losses beyond those associated with other management measures, yet produced the highest stable catch levels. Moreover, peak catches with reserves occurred with less restriction than peak catches with other management measures. These results were consistent across two species that matured before entering the fishery but did not apply to one species that was fished while immature. In that latter case, minimum size limits produced more substantial benefits than reserves could. Nevertheless, these analyses suggest that a wide range of circumstances exist where reserves, if properly designed to minimize adult spillover while allowing abundant larval transport, can maximize fisheries harvests with a minimum of total restrictions.},

Temporal, non-permanent, rotational or periodically harvested area closures have been employed across the Indo-Paciﬁc for centuries and are a common measure within contemporary community-based and co-management frameworks. Although prior evidence suggests that periodic closures may confer ﬁsheries beneﬁts for some taxa or in certain conditions, there is little evidence that they are equally effective for the sustainable management of the many types of small-scale ﬁsheries important in the Indo-Paciﬁc. Case studies of periodic closures are reviewed to highlight the variations in target species, harvesting periodicity and ﬁshing pressure that will inﬂuence the ﬁsheries management effectiveness of this tool. Fisheries management beneﬁts are observed for short-lived, fast-growing taxa or for a range of taxa in low ﬁshing pressure situations. Stocks declines are observed for long-lived taxa or for a range of taxa if harvesting is intense. It is argued that community-based and co-management policy and action must better account for these factors when promoting and implementing periodic closures for medium- to long-term ﬁsheries management or conservation goals.},

The length of time that a closure is in place can play a determinative role in the effectiveness of the closure as a means of restoring stock biomass and diversity. For species that are slow growing and slow to reproduce, closures shorter than a decade are unlikely to be sufﬁcient for the effects of restoration to accrue. New Zealand has two legislative mechanisms speciﬁcally designed to establish temporary closures: sections 186A and 186B of the Fisheries Act 1996. These provisions were created to respond to localised depletion and to provide for the use and management practices of Māori (New Zealand’s Indigenous People). There is currently a two-year time limit on temporary closures applied for by the community. By deﬁning a time limit for temporary closures legislators have failed to account for the ecology of many of the species targeted for protection that require longer periods of protection for restoration. Furthermore, the way in which the ﬁnal decision making power is vested with central government is also inconsistent with the original purpose of the provisions. An amendment to the temporary closure provisions is suggested to provide greater ﬂexibility for users and to better recognise the non-commercial ﬁshing rights provided for by the Fisheries Act 1996, of local communities seeking to apply this tool.},

	abstract = {Assessing the carbon footprint of marine bivalve aquaculture demands an accurate estimation of the CO2 release associated to capital goods and aquaculture operations but also to the metabolic CO2 budget of the cultured species. Nowadays, there are discrepancies on the processes to include in that budget, how to estimate them, and which scale should be applied, from individual to ecosystem. Site-speciﬁc environmental conditions and culture methods also affect signiﬁcantly the estimates. Here, we have gathered environmental, biochemical and metabolic data from published scientiﬁc articles, reports and existing databases to present the metabolic CO2 budget for mussel aquaculture in the coastal inlets of the Northwest Iberian upwelling. We analyse the contribution of mussel ﬂesh and shell production jointly and separately. At the individual scale, the shell CO2 budget is estimated from CO2 removal by shell matrix protein synthesis and CO2 release during calciﬁcation and respiration to support shell maintenance. Organic carbon in mussel ﬂesh and CO2 released by respiration to support ﬂesh maintenance contribute to the ﬂesh CO2 budget. Only calciﬁcation and respiration processes are considered when estimating the metabolic carbon footprint of individual mussels because organic carbon in mussel ﬂesh and shell returns to the atmosphere as CO2 in a relatively short period. While the metabolic carbon footprint associated to mussel shell remains constant at 365 kg CO2 per ton of shell, it varies from 92 to 578 kg CO2 per ton of mussel ﬂesh. This large variability depends on mussel seeding time and harvesting size, due to the differential seasonal growth patterns of ﬂesh and shell. Inclusion of the CO2 potentially immobilised in mussel faeces buried in the sediments would lead to a reduction of the metabolic carbon footprint estimates by up to 6 \% compared with the individual estimates.},

Marine aquaculture (mariculture) generates 37.5\% of this production and 97\% of the world’s seaweed harvest. Mariculture products may offer a climate-friendly, high-protein food source, because they often have lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emission footprints than do the equivalent products farmed on land. However, sustainable intensification of low-emissions mariculture is key to maintaining a low GHG footprint as production scales up to meet future demand. We examine the major GHG sources and carbon sinks associated with fed finfish, macroalgae and bivalve mariculture, and the factors influencing variability across sectors. We highlight knowledge gaps and provide recommendations for GHG emissions reductions and carbon storage, including accounting for interactions between mariculture operations and surrounding marine ecosystems. By linking the provision of maricultured products to GHG abatement opportunities, we can advance climate-friendly practices that generate sustainable environmental, social, and economic outcomes.},

Site-speciﬁc environmental conditions and culture methods also affect signiﬁcantly the estimates. Here, we have gathered environmental, biochemical and metabolic data from published scientiﬁc articles, reports and existing databases to present the metabolic CO2 budget for mussel aquaculture in the coastal inlets of the Northwest Iberian upwelling. We analyse the contribution of mussel ﬂesh and shell production jointly and separately. At the individual scale, the shell CO2 budget is estimated from CO2 removal by shell matrix protein synthesis and CO2 release during calciﬁcation and respiration to support shell maintenance. Organic carbon in mussel ﬂesh and CO2 released by respiration to support ﬂesh maintenance contribute to the ﬂesh CO2 budget. Only calciﬁcation and respiration processes are considered when estimating the metabolic carbon footprint of individual mussels because organic carbon in mussel ﬂesh and shell returns to the atmosphere as CO2 in a relatively short period. While the metabolic carbon footprint associated to mussel shell remains constant at 365 kg CO2 per ton of shell, it varies from 92 to 578 kg CO2 per ton of mussel ﬂesh. This large variability depends on mussel seeding time and harvesting size, due to the differential seasonal growth patterns of ﬂesh and shell. Inclusion of the CO2 potentially immobilised in mussel faeces buried in the sediments would lead to a reduction of the metabolic carbon footprint estimates by up to 6 \% compared with the individual estimates.},

Using a structural foresight modeling approach, this paper examines past, present, and future trends of fish supply and demand in Africa to highlight challenges and prospects of the fish sector's contribution to food security in the continent. If historical trends are maintained, growth of aquaculture and fisheries would be slow, resulting in declining per capita fish consumption. Alternative scenarios highlight the potential importance of African aquaculture development in addressing food security. Policies to promote sustainable aquaculture, reduce post-harvest losses, and facilitate fish trade are indispensable. Fish deserves more attention in food and nutrition policies due to its prominence in the African food basket.},

In these regions, shrimp cultivation is identified as a profitable business and one of the main reasons for clearing of mangroves to construct shrimp farms. Against this backdrop and based on the first author's previous PhD research and other relevant scholarly works, in this commentary we discuss the aspects and contexts of the mangrove-based integrated shrimp farming system. Then, we recommend a model of co-management and a set of policy option towards sustainable silvo-aquaculture to protect/restore the mangrove forests and sustain shrimp production in coastal areas of Bangladesh. Mangroves and shrimp culture are not necessarily incompatible. Many mangrove species have been identified as beneficial for shrimp culture for a number of possible reasons. Most importantly, the nutrients in the leaf litter of several mangrove species have been found to enhance natural food production for shrimp. Besides the nutrient input, the leaf litter also provides surface area for biofilm development, on which different life stages of shrimp can graze. In addition, the combination of mangrove leaf litter and feed has been shown to enhance shrimp production synergistically. Additional economic benefits from mangrove-shrimp co-management include the production of timber (e.g. buildings, boats and fuel woods) and non-timber products (e.g. fruits, honey, fibers, firewood, resins and bark). Thus, mangrove-based aquaculture or silvo-aquaculture system can be considered as a nature-based solution to sustainably revitalize the economy in coastal areas where shrimp has been the economic mainstay. Though there are positive effects, we point out some potential negative impacts of mangrove-based shrimp culture, like the anti-nutrients content in the leaf litter, which might impact shrimp production. In addition, the long term use of mangrove leaf litter might degrade the water quality. Therefore, the co-management policy recommends a controlled practice of mangroves in shrimp culture to balance conservation of mangrove-based ecology and profitable shrimp production.

With projected rapid continual growth in the sector, if left unmanaged, aquaculture pollution can have detrimental environmental and social implications. Using the DPSIR framework, the paper examines current practices and pathways of plastic pollution from marine aquaculture in the NE-Atlantic, drawing on findings from literature, stakeholder consultations and beach litter assessments. Pathways for aquaculture-related litter identified include rough weather, farmer behavior, inadequate access to recycling facilities, low price of consumable plastics and high cost of recycling. Beach litter analyses conducted as part of the study exposed serious issues of under quantification, resulting from difficulties in source identification and a lack of detailed categorization in official monitoring systems. The paper makes recommendations to improve litter quantification and waste management, including the use of local knowledge and experts to identify sources of marine litter.},

	abstract = {Immunization programs have often been impeded by vaccine scares, as evidenced by the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) autism vaccine scare in Britain. A ‘‘free rider’’ effect may be partly responsible: vaccine-generated herd immunity can reduce disease incidence to such low levels that real or imagined vaccine risks appear large in comparison, causing individuals to cease vaccinating. This implies a feedback loop between disease prevalence and strategic individual vaccinating behavior. Here, we analyze a model based on evolutionary game theory that captures this feedback in the context of vaccine scares, and that also includes social learning. Vaccine risk perception evolves over time according to an exogenously imposed curve. We test the model against vaccine coverage data and disease incidence data from two vaccine scares in England \& Wales: the whole cell pertussis vaccine scare and the MMR vaccine scare. The model fits vaccine coverage data from both vaccine scares relatively well. Moreover, the model can explain the vaccine coverage data more parsimoniously than most competing models without social learning and/or feedback (hence, adding social learning and feedback to a vaccine scare model improves model fit with little or no parsimony penalty). Under some circumstances, the model can predict future vaccine coverage and disease incidence—up to 10 years in advance in the case of pertussis—including specific qualitative features of the dynamics, such as future incidence peaks and undulations in vaccine coverage due to the population’s response to changing disease incidence. Vaccine scares could become more common as eradication goals are approached for more vaccine-preventable diseases. Such models could help us predict how vaccine scares might unfold and assist mitigation efforts.},

The main objective is to study the effect of slow time scale delays on the convergence of the replicator dynamics to the Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS). In particular, we investigate the effect of time delays on the stability of the replicator dynamics. We can distinguish two types of the time delay: strategic delay which is the delay associated with the strategies of players, and spatial delay, which is the delay associated with the communities of the players. We prove that for large strategic delays, the mixed intermediate ESS may become an unstable state for the replicator dynamics, while for any value of the spatial delay, the replicator dynamics converge to the intermediate ESS. We also show that when both types of the time delay coexist, the instability property is emphasized.},

	abstract = {Since the Balearics are one of the key tourism destinations in Europe, the tourism industry has entailed a radical transformation of coastal life on the islands. In the 1960s and 1970s, fish captures increased enormously due to the expansion of consumption derived from tourism, and through technological improvements. There has been a change in target species from cheap fish consumed by local people towards expensive species consumed by tourists. However, since the 1980s a combination of factors including the adoption of the EU Common Fisheries Policy, the globalization of trade, and overfishing of some target species has led to a drastic fall in fishing sector jobs, catch reductions, and an increase in cheap imports. This article analyses the transformation of Balearic fisheries combining ecological economics (EE) and political ecology (PE) approaches. Material flow accounting (MFA) and the ecological footprint (EF) are applied in order to conceptualize the biophysical dimension of fisheries in relation to the historical dynamics of capital in the archipelago. Between 1940 and 2012, total fish catches doubled the official landings, while nonreported or hidden catches were underestimated. In the neoliberal period (1990-2012), fish catches decreased and seafood consumption was satisfied mainly through imports, five times the local captures. Thus, the metabolism of fish consumption in the Balearics illustrates the logics of capital and its metabolism in advanced capitalist regions, characterized by the displacement of socio-ecological conflicts to distant waters.},

	abstract = {There exists an interplay between vaccine coverage, disease prevalence and the vaccinating behaviour of individuals. Moreover, because of herd immunity, there is also a strategic interaction between individuals when they are deciding whether or not to vaccinate, because the probability that an individual becomes infected depends upon how many other individuals are vaccinated. To understand this potentially complex interplay, a game dynamic model is developed in which individuals adopt strategies according to an imitation dynamic (a learning process), and base vaccination decisions on disease prevalence and perceived risks of vaccines and disease. The model predicts that oscillations in vaccine uptake are more likely in populations where individuals imitate others more readily or where vaccinating behaviour is more sensitive to changes in disease prevalence. Oscillations are also more likely when the perceived risk of vaccines is high. The model reproduces salient features of the time evolution of vaccine uptake and disease prevalence during the whole-cell pertussis vaccine scare in England and Wales during the 1970s. This suggests that using game theoretical models to predict, and even manage, the population dynamics of vaccinating behaviour may be feasible.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models that couple disease dynamics and vaccinating behaviour often assume that the incentive to vaccinate disappears if disease prevalence is zero. Hence, they predict that vaccine refusal should be the rule, and elimination should be difficult or impossible. In reality, countries with non-mandatory vaccination policies have usually been able to maintain elimination or very low incidence of paediatric infectious diseases for long periods of time. Here, we show that including injunctive social norms can reconcile such behaviour-incidence models to observations. Adding social norms to a coupled behaviour-incidence model enables the model to better explain pertussis vaccine uptake and disease dynamics in the UK from 1967 to 2010, in both the vaccine-scare years and the years of high vaccine coverage. The model also illustrates how a vaccine scare can perpetuate suboptimal vaccine coverage long after perceived risk has returned to baseline, pre-vaccine-scare levels. However, at other model parameter values, social norms can perpetuate depressed vaccine coverage during a vaccine scare well beyond the time when the population's baseline vaccine risk perception returns to pre-scare levels. Social norms can strongly suppress vaccine uptake despite frequent outbreaks, as observed in some small communities. Significant portions of the parameter space also exhibit bistability, meaning long-term outcomes depend on the initial conditions. Depending on the context, social norms can either support or hinder immunization goals.},

            Ecosystems provide a range of services that can benefit people. However, the extent to which people are able to harness those benefits depends not only on the supply of ecosystem services but also on their capacity to access them via a range of social, economic, and institutional mechanisms. Here, we examine how people perceive ecosystem service benefits across 28 coral reef fishing communities in four countries. We quantitatively show that bundles of benefits are mediated by key access mechanisms (e.g., rights-based, economic, knowledge, social, and institutional). Interestingly, social, institutional, and knowledge mechanisms were associated with the greatest number and diversity of benefits. Resource managers can focus on these access mechanisms to maximize ecosystem service benefits while minimizing human–environment impacts.
          , 
            Ecosystem services are supplied by nature but, by definition, are received by people. Ecosystem service assessments, intended to influence the decisions people make regarding their interactions with nature, need to understand how people benefit from different ecosystem services. A critical question is therefore, What determines the distribution of ecosystem service benefits between different sections of society? Here, we use an entitlements approach to examine how people perceive ecosystem service benefits across 28 coral reef fishing communities in four countries. In doing so, we quantitatively show that bundles of benefits are mediated by key access mechanisms (e.g., rights-based, economic, knowledge, social, and institutional). We find that specific access mechanisms influence which ecosystem services people prioritize. Social, institutional, and knowledge mechanisms are associated with the largest number and diversity of benefits. However, local context strongly determines whether specific access mechanisms enable or constrain benefits. Local ecological knowledge enabled people to prioritize a habitat benefit in Kenya, but constrained people from prioritizing the same benefit in Madagascar. Ecosystem service assessments, and their resultant policies, need to include the broad suite of access mechanisms that enable different people to benefit from a supply of ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Endangered forest–grassland mosaics interspersed with expanding agriculture and silviculture occur across many parts of the world, including the southern Brazilian highlands. This natural mosaic ecosystem is thought to reflect alternative stable states driven by threshold responses of recruitment to fire and moisture regimes. The role of adaptive human behavior in such systems remains understudied, despite its pervasiveness and the fact that such ecosystems can exhibit complex dynamics. We develop a nonlinear mathematical model of coupled human–environment dynamics in mosaic systems and social processes regarding conservation and economic land valuation. Our objective is to better understand how the coupled dynamics respond to changes in ecological and social conditions. The model is parameterized with southern Brazilian data on mosaic ecology, land-use profits, and questionnaire results concerning landowner preferences and conservation values. We find that the mosaic presently resides at a crucial juncture where relatively small changes in social conditions can generate a wide variety of possible outcomes, including complete loss of mosaics; large-amplitude, long-term oscillations between land states that preclude ecosystem stability; and conservation of the mosaic even to the exclusion of agriculture/silviculture. In general, increasing the time horizon used for conservation decision making is more likely to maintain mosaic stability. In contrast, increasing the inherent conservation value of either forests or grasslands is more likely to induce large oscillations—especially for forests—due to feedback from rarity-based conservation decisions. Given the potential for complex dynamics, empirically grounded nonlinear dynamical models should play a larger role in policy formulation for human–environment mosaic ecosystems.},

The paper focuses mostly on the trade in live reef ﬁsh, with reference also to sea cucumber and shark ﬁn. In the light of recent discussions of social and environmental change in Southeast Asia, the paper addresses how the intensiﬁcation of coastal livelihoods has manifested in important trends, including an increasing reliance on high-value commodity ﬁsheries such as the trade in luxury seafood. Important consequences of this intensiﬁcation of coastal livelihoods include environmental degradation, and social change due to the development of broader trading networks. The paper argues that the live reef ﬁsh for food trade is an important contemporary livelihood that highlights the ways in which Chinese consumption is having diverse social and environmental consequences for source countries in Southeast Asia.},

Here we explore social, political, and ecological aspects of a transformation in governance of Chile's coastal marine resources, from 1980 to today. Critical elements in the initial preparatory phase of the transformation were (
              i
              ) recognition of the depletion of resource stocks, (
              ii
              ) scientific knowledge on the ecology and resilience of targeted species and their role in ecosystem dynamics, and (
              iii
              ) demonstration-scale experimental trials, building on smaller-scale scientific experiments, which identified new management pathways. The trials improved cooperation among scientists and fishers, integrating knowledge and establishing trust. Political turbulence and resource stock collapse provided a window of opportunity that triggered the transformation, supported by new enabling legislation. Essential elements to navigate this transformation were the ability to network knowledge from the local level to influence the decision-making processes at the national level, and a preexisting social network of fishers that provided political leverage through a national confederation of artisanal fishing collectives. The resultant governance scheme includes a revolutionary national system of marine tenure that allocates user rights and responsibilities to fisher collectives. Although fine tuning is necessary to build resilience of this new regime, this transformation has improved the sustainability of the interconnected social–ecological system. Our analysis of how this transformation unfolded provides insights into how the Chilean system could be further developed and identifies generalized pathways for improved governance of marine resources around the world.},

We simultaneously explored measures of reef and socioeconomic conservation success at four national parks, four comanaged reserves, and three traditionally managed areas in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Underwater visual censuses of key ecological indicators [7, 8] revealed that the average size and biomass of ﬁshes were higher in all areas under traditional management and at one comanaged reserve when compared to nearby unmanaged areas. Socioeconomic assessments [6, 9, 10] revealed that this ‘‘effective conservation’’ was positively related to compliance, visibility of the reserve, and length of time the management had been in place but negatively related to market integration, wealth, and village population size. We suggest that in cases where the resources for enforcement are lacking, management regimes that are designed to meet community goals can achieve greater compliance and subsequent conservation success than regimes designed primarily for biodiversity conservation.},

Humans act as a major vector for the spread of these pests via firewood transport, although existing models do not explicitly capture human decision-making regarding firewood transport. In this paper we present a two-patch coupled human-environment system model that includes social influence and long-distance firewood transport and examines potential strategies for mitigating pest spread. We found that increasing concern regarding infestations (f) significantly reduced infestation. Additionally it resulted in multiple thresholds at which the intensity of infestation in a patch was decreased. It was also found that a decrease in the cost of firewood purchased in the area where it is supposed to be burned (Cl) resulted in an increased proportion of local-firewood strategists, and a 67\% decrease in Cl from \$6.75 to \$4.50 was sufficient to eliminate crosspatch infestation. These effects are synergistic: increasing concern through awareness and education campaigns acts together with reduced firewood costs, thereby reducing the required threshold of both awareness and economic incentives. Our results indicate that the best management strategy includes a combination of public education paired with firewood subsidization.},

Nonetheless, the effect of ethnicity on social network structure in an ethnically diverse common-pool resource system is virtually unknown. We characterize the entire social network of Hawaii’s longline fishery, an ethnically diverse competitive pelagic fishery, and investigate network homophily, network structure, and cross-scale linkages. Results show that ethnicity significantly influences social network structure and is responsible for a homophily effect, which can create challenges for stakeholder collaboration across groups. Our analysis also suggests that ethnicity influences the formation of diverse network structures, and can affect the level of linkages to outside industry leaders, government or management officials, and members of the scientific community. This study provides the first empirical examination of the impact of ethnic diversity on resource user’s social networks in the common-pool resource literature, having important implications for collaborative resource management.},

In south west Madagascar, community-managed temporary closures of octopus (Octopus cyanea) fisheries have become a popular approach in management of the resource, and have been shown to increase catches with lasting results. Women regionally account for well over half of octopus fishers, and are influenced by efforts to manage the resource. We assessed the role of gender in this fisheries management initiative, comparing fisheries landings for men and women over a seven-year period, and assessing female involvement in the management process through a series of focus groups and workshop discussions. Our findings showed that, while both genders benefit from the fisheries management initiative, men tend to harvest bigger octopus and dominate reserve management discourse and decision-making. We discuss these findings in relation to other natural resource management initiatives and recommend strategies to ensure better integration of women in octopus fishery management.},

La collecte des informations se réalise dans les six principaux lieux de pêches fréquentés par les pêcheurs d’Andavadoaka. La production de poulpe change suivant la saison et que la bonne
saison de capture s’observe pendant la saison fraîche. Des jeunes individus profitent le platier peu profond avant de migrer vers le milieu profond pour se reproduire. L’observation directe de l’appareil eproducteur mâle a permis de savoir les 3 stades de maturité sexuelle. L’échelle de maturité sexuelle chez les femelles de poulpe repose sur l’étude microscopique de l’état des ovocytes. Cinq stades de maturité ont été trouvés avec l’analyse microscopique des ovocytes et devaient avoir des correspondances avec la forme et la couleur de l’appareil reproducteur femelle. On peut distinguer le sexe de l’animal extérieurement par l’existence de bras hectocotyl pour le male et par la différence de gonades à l’intérieur du manteau. Les ovocytes immatures se développent dans l’ovaire jusqu’à l’expulsion. La fécondation se passe au niveau de l’oviducte. L’activité de la  reproduction se passe d’une façon continue pour cette espèce. Deux périodes de pontes maximales ont été observées à partir de la combinaison de l’analyse de pourcentage
de recrutement, de sex-ratio et de la variation de maturité sexuelle. La première période se
passe dans la transition entre la saison chaude et la saison fraîche (avril-mai), et la seconde qui est la plus importante s’étale pendant la période de transition entre la saison sèche et la saison de pluie (novembre-janvier). Pour assurer la pérennité de cette importante source de revenue, il est important de suivre les réglementations de pêche au poulpe. Ainsi la fermeture temporaire de certain site de pêche aide les paysans à comprendre l’importance de la gestion durable de la ressource et à combler les lacunes dues au non respect de ces règlementations.},

	abstract = {Several of the protected areas within the Albertine Rift are contiguous with protected areas across international boundaries. This is particularly true for the Greater Virunga Landscape, which includes Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and ten contiguous protected areas in Uganda and Rwanda. The larger bodied animal species that occur in this landscape have moved freely across what are now international borders for millennia and some species probably need this larger landscape if their populations are to remain viable. An analysis was carried out to identify these ‘landscape species’ and the importance of this cross-border movement is assessed in the light of civil wars in the region. For 13 years the International Gorilla Conservation Programme has been working in the Virunga Volcanoes and Bwindi Impenetrable National Park to foster transboundary collaboration. The results have shown that regular meetings and planning of activities by wardens can lead to better conservation even with countries at war with each other. More recently the Wildlife Conservation Society has started a programme to support transboundary collaboration further north in the landscape so that all contiguous protected areas are working together. The results show that mountain gorilla numbers have on the whole increased during the past 25 years despite civil wars in the region and this can largely be attributed to their ability to generate income from tourism but also to enhanced transboundary collaboration between Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. Ungulate numbers on the other hand have declined drastically since the 1960s but it is shown that the connectivity in the landscape has been important in reducing the impact of the civil war on elephants.},

	abstract = {We present a model of a fish population present on two patches connected by migrations. Fish grow logistically on each patch and are caught. We assume that migrations between the two sites are fast relative to local growth and fishing. Taking advantage of the time scales, we use methods of aggregation of variables to obtain a reduced model governing the total biomass of the fish population at a slow time scale. We are looking for the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for the system of the two connected patches. We show that although the total equilibrium population may be greater than the sum of the carrying capacities on each isolated site, the total catch is always less than or equal to the sum of the catches on the isolated fishing sites. We then consider a prey–predator community of fish in the same environment. We assume that only the predator is caught and not its prey, growing logistically on each site. We study the Lotka–Volterra prey–predator model as well as the model with a type II Holling functional response. We show that the total catch at MSY of the system of connected sites can be greater than the sum of the captures on each isolated site. This result is obtained when a fishing site with a large prey carrying capacity and an average growth rate is connected to a site with a small carrying capacity but a large growth rate. Finally, we discuss fishery management methods on two fishing sites for the Lotka–Volterra model as well as the Holling type II model in the case of a prey refuge.},

	abstract = {Sudden changes in populations are ubiquitous in ecological systems, especially under perturbations. The agents of global change may increase the frequency and severity of anthropogenic perturbations, but complex populations’ responses hamper our understanding of their dynamics and resilience. Furthermore, the long-term environmental and demographic data required to study those sudden changes are rare. Fitting dynamical models with an artificial intelligence algorithm to population fluctuations over 40 y in a social bird reveals that feedback in dispersal after a cumulative perturbation drives a population collapse. The collapse is well described by a nonlinear function mimicking social copying, whereby dispersal made by a few individuals induces others to leave the patch in a behavioral cascade for decision-making to disperse. Once a threshold for deterioration of the quality of the patch is crossed, there is a tipping point for a social response of runaway dispersal corresponding to social copying feedback. Finally, dispersal decreases at low population densities, which is likely due to the unwillingness of the more philopatric individuals to disperse. In providing the evidence of copying for the emergence of feedback in dispersal in a social organism, our results suggest a broader impact of self-organized collective dispersal in complex population dynamics. This has implications for the theoretical study of population and metapopulation nonlinear dynamics, including population extinction, and managing of endangered and harvested populations of social animals subjected to behavioral feedback loops.},

Fragmentation due to physical barriers may further impact the ﬁshery by reducing ﬁsh passage. Our goal was to estimate basinwide parameters (i.e. movement, survival and capture probabilities) of a large-river species known to move throughout watersheds. We tagged13 892 Channel Catﬁsh in the Red River of the North (Red River) and Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, Canada, and collected 553 recaptures. We estimated 2.2\% of catﬁsh are moving from the Red River to Lake Winnipeg each month and 9.4\%, primarily large ({\textgreater}600 mm) individuals, moved upstream through a dam (monthly). Approximately 5.6\% of catﬁsh moved to the USA each month, and only one ﬁsh returned. Our results suggest the lower reaches of the Red River may be a source population for the USA, where survival is lower, and Lake Winnipeg. The complex movements of Channel Catﬁsh throughout the Red River, across barriers and international boundaries, suggest conservation and management of ﬁsh populations should be watershed wide.

The same species can be fully protected or heavily harvested on different sides of a border. This can generate a source–sink dynamic from the areas with lower to those with higher mortality, a process known as compensatory immigration. We tested this hypothesis on the wolverine (Gulo gulo) population of southern Scandinavia, which is shared between two countries: Sweden and Norway. Wolverines are fully protected in Sweden, but subject to intensive population regulation in Norway. Using non-invasive genetic sampling and capture–recapture modeling, we analyzed the dynamics of wolverine survival and emigration patterns between 2002 and 2013. Wolverines in Norway experienced a lower survival than in Sweden. Migration across the national border was directed towards movements from Sweden to Norway. There was a functional relationship between harvest rate in Norway and emigration rates across the national border, both at the individual and population level, thus conﬁrming the compensatory immigration hypothesis. Contrasting management regimes within the same population can generate undesired demographic and spatial dynamics, jeopardize conservation goals on the two sides of a border, and reduce the efﬁciency of management actions. This calls for the adoption of a coordinate population approach in large carnivore conservation and management. Failing to do so can cause a waste of the already limited resources allocated for large carnivore conservation, and it might hinder effective conﬂict mitigation.},

Non-parametric survival was 0.733 (95\% CI 0.622e0.816), and the top Bayesian survival model indicated that wolves outside the park had much lower annual survival rates (0.44, 95\% BCI ¼ 0.24e0.65) compared to wolves inside the park (0.84, 95\% BCI ¼ 0.73e0.91). The cumulative risk of mortality was on average 6.7 times higher (odds ratio 95\% BCI ¼ 2.2e21.4) for wolves outside the park, peaking during the winter hunting and trapping seasons. We found weak evidence for declining survival over time, opposite to patterns predicted by densitydependence. Bayesian cause-speciﬁc mortality indicated that the top three sources of mortality were trapping (rate ¼ 0.080, 36\% of mortality), followed by hunting (0.053, 18\%), and highway (0.046, 18\%) mortality. Surprisingly, we found no intraspeciﬁc mortality, and low dispersal from Banff National Park. This demographic proﬁle is akin to other exploited populations across North America. While we were unable to combine survival rates with reproduction to estimate population trends, the overall mortality rates within our study area are consistent with a stable wolf population. Nonetheless, the long-term stability and ecological effectiveness of wolves likely differed inside and outside of protected areas, which highlights a challenge with managing transboundary carnivores exposed to different management regimes.},

	abstract = {Migration presents challenges and opportunities for both origin and destination communities. It should be emphasized that much of the migration discourse has only focused on the origin more than the destination. Hence, the dramatic changes in the flow of migrants across international borders, as well as accelerating internal movements of rural migrants in the direction of the cities are practically reshaping our world. It is a truism that agriculture and human advancement are keys to addressing the fundamental causes of migration. According to (FAO, 2018), over half of the populace in the least developed countries will still live in rural areas in the year 20150. Three-quarters of the extreme poor base their livelihoods on agriculture or other rural activities. In the African continent, Eleven million young people will enter the labor market every year for the next ten years. Thus, agriculture can be categorized as the backbone of human subsistence and its stanchion for human existence surpasses any other area of endeavor. It provides employment to individuals and business support to organizations. However, despite its importance, there has been a continuous reduction in the number of people directly involved in agriculture, especially in developing countries. In Nigeria for example, the attraction to the city which is the ‘Pull factor”, white-collared jobs, price instability, income instability, herdsmen/farmer crisis, general insecurity, government intervention among others have reduced the number of people participating directly in agriculture. Economic issues such as deficit in trade, uncertain availability of food, generation of income, poverty reduction and creation of employment could be catered by the government by enacting pro-agricultural laws and providing incentives in various forms which includes provisions agricultural technology, tax reliefs, easy access to loans, security of lives and livestock, infrastructural development, irrigation trenches in desert areas, supply of fertilizers, control of usage of insecticides. Nigeria should come up with effective, pragmatic and workable agricultural plan and policy to harness the massive possibility of agricultural commercialization to fulfil the internal consumption demands and also for the purpose of export. There is also the need to process raw materials into finished products. For many smallholder farmers and herders, moving away from rural areas is an attractive opportunity to diversify livelihoods, escape slow-outbreak events which include climate change and degeneration of the environment, seek improved social services, and reunite with family members. This paper will interrogate instances of policies in receiving countries that empower the displaced and capitalize on opportunities that can arise from a global population shift. This research paper assesses the relationship between migration, human development, and agriculture and also raises and answers question on how we can enhance the development potential of migration in order to achieve zero hunger. Therefore, this paper concludes with the prospects and limitations of commercialization of agriculture and provides suggestions of ways for advancement using Nigeria as an example. It also seeks to suggest ways to make agriculture more vibrant and robust, which if attained, will reduce reliance on oil and gas as the predominantly sources of revenue generation.},

	abstract = {Successful conservation of species that roam and disperse over large areas requires detailed understanding of their movement patterns and connectivity between subpopulations. But empirical information on movement, space use, and connectivity is lacking for many species, and data acquisition is often hindered when study animals cross international borders. The African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) exempliﬁes such species that require vast undisturbed areas to support viable, self‐sustaining populations. To study wild dog dispersal and investigate potential barriers to movements and causes of mortality during dispersal, between 2016 and 2019 we followed the fate of 16 dispersing coalitions (i.e., same‐sex group of ≥1 dispersing African wild dogs) in northern Botswana through global positioning system (GPS)‐satellite telemetry. Dispersing wild dogs covered ≤54 km in 24 hours and traveled 150 km to Namibia and 360 km to Zimbabwe within 10 days. Wild dogs were little hindered in their movements by natural landscape features, whereas medium to densely human‐populated landscapes represented obstacles to dispersal. Human‐caused mortality was responsible for {\textgreater}90\% of the recorded deaths. Our results suggest that a holistic approach to the management and conservation of highly mobile species is necessary to develop eﬀective research and evidence‐based conservation programs across transfrontier protected areas, including the need for coordinated research eﬀorts through collaboration between national and international conservation authorities. © 2020 The Wildlife Society.},

Early work emphasized the role of seasonality in driving cyclic population dynamics, but the consequences of seasonality for ecological processes are far broader. Yet, seasonality is often not explicitly included in either empirical or theoretical studies. Many aspects of ecological dynamics can only be understood when seasonality is included, ranging from the oscillations in the incidence of childhood diseases to the coexistence of species. Through several case studies, we outline what is now known about seasonality in an ecological context and set the stage for future efforts. We discuss various approaches and tools for incorporating seasonality in mathematical models. We argue, however, that these tools are still limited in scope and more easily-accessible approaches need to be developed.},

	abstract = {In complex systems, a critical transition is a shift in a system’s dynamical regime from its current state to a strongly contrasting state as external conditions move beyond a tipping point. These transitions are often preceded by characteristic early warning signals such as increased system variability. However, early warning signals in complex, coupled human–environment systems (HESs) remain little studied. Here, we compare critical transitions and their early warning signals in a coupled HES model to an equivalent environment model uncoupled from the human system. We parameterize the HES model, using social and ecological data from old-growth forests in Oregon. We find that the coupled HES exhibits a richer variety of dynamics and regime shifts than the uncoupled environment system. Moreover, the early warning signals in the coupled HES can be ambiguous, heralding either an era of ecosystem conservationism or collapse of both forest ecosystems and conservationism. The presence of human feedback in the coupled HES can also mitigate the early warning signal, making it more difficult to detect the oncoming regime shift. We furthermore show how the coupled HES can be “doomed to criticality”: Strategic human interactions cause the system to remain perpetually in the vicinity of a collapse threshold, as humans become complacent when the resource seems protected but respond rapidly when it is under immediate threat. We conclude that the opportunities, benefits, and challenges of modeling regime shifts and early warning signals in coupled HESs merit further research.},

This is exempliﬁed in the U.S. Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) ﬁshery which uses a rotational scheme of temporary closed areas in both offshore and nearshore waters. The closed areas are generally hundreds to thousands square kilometers, but a group of inshore commercial scallop harvesters were interested in the effect of closing a much smaller area (3 km2), which had sustained valuable harvest before recent poor yields. To describe changes in scallop abundance and size within and around this closure, two independent surveys, a drop camera and diver transect, were conducted through industry–academic collaboration. In addition, this unusual union of a predominately offshore method, the drop camera, and inshore method, divers, was used to better interpret the results of each method. The drop camera survey results suggested that the closure signiﬁcantly increased the biomass of exploitable scallops, showing that even closure orders of magnitude smaller than commonly used for scallops can be effective. Although the dive survey did not show this, understanding the uncertainties of each method helped resolve this discrepancy. Drop camera densities were calculated from a broader spatial area more representative of the entire area with increased sample size. By contrast, the dive survey provided an intensive description of scallops at each individual survey site. Combining a drop camera survey with dive stations to collect scallop measurements would provide densities from a spatial scale representative of the study area while improving shell height frequency estimation and providing biological data. In addition, this project demonstrated how stakeholder engagement supported by academic institutions and ﬁshery managers can allow intensive monitoring of small ﬁshery closed areas outside of government assessments.},

Herbivory was estimated by assay and biomass methods, and both methods indicated higher herbivory in Wshery closures. Despite higher herbivory, the eVect of the ENSO disturbance was larger within these closures, with reefs undergoing a temporary transition from dominance by hard and soft coral to a temporary dominance of turf and erect algae that ended in the dominance of calcifying algae, massive Porites, Pocillopora and a few faviids six years after the disturbance. The Wshed reefs changed the least but had a greater cover of turf and erect algae and sponge shortly after the disturbance. Higher herbivory in the Wshery closures reduced the abundance and persistence of herbivore-susceptible erect algae and created space and appropriate substratum for recruiting corals. Nonetheless, other post-settlement processes may have had strong inXuences such that annual rates of coral recovery were low (»2\%) and not diVerent between the management regimes. Recovery, as deWned as and measured by the return to predisturbance coral cover and the dominant taxa, was slower in Wshery closures than unmanaged reefs.},

The study contributes to the understanding of historical events that have discouraged the take-off and scale-up of community-based conservation approaches, such as locally-managed marine areas (LMMAs). LMMAs are being promoted increasingly as a desirable approach in marine conservation. However, there are a limited numbers of cases where such initiatives have been used as a strategy for marine management in sub-Saharan Africa, and very few operational examples of such schemes exist in the Western Indian Ocean region. Through semi-structured questionnaires, 193 community members selected randomly from 15 villages of the Mnazi Bay-Ruvuma Estuary Marine Park (MBREMP), Mtwara district, Southern Tanzania, were interviewed about their attitudes towards efforts to promote local management and the conservation of marine resources. The study also involved 17 focus group discussions, 13 in-depth key informant interviews, participant observation, and a review of secondary information. Over 85\% of the questionnaire respondents commented that there was insufﬁcient participation by legitimate community representatives in the development of the MBREMP. Almost 90\% of the respondents agreed that the management of marine areas has increased signiﬁcantly, particularly in the last two decades following initiatives by the government, donors and external NGOs. However, 70\% of the questionnaire responders had observed that a rapid shift from centralised to community-based management has been hindered by a lack of acceptable community rules and by communities frequently equating conservation with prohibition. Developing LMMAs in areas based on the lessons learned from MPAs could be a better alternative to developing entirely new communitymanaged areas; however, this can only succeed if limitations including the key principles of community participation and empowerment are addressed.},

	abstract = {Since 2004, the creation of locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) in Madagascar has exponentially increased, highlighting the need for improved information sharing between communities and between support organizations. Until recently, however, these LMMAs operated in relative isolation, with little communication or coordination between LMMA community associations. Madagascar’s first national LMMA forum was held to address this need in June 2012 in the village of Andavadoaka, on Madagascar’s southwest coast. The forum brought together 55 community members from 18 LMMAs throughout Madagascar, representing a total of 134 villages. A principle outcome of this meeting was the formation of a national LMMA network named MIHARI, a Malagasy acronym that translates into ‘local marine resource management’. The nascent MIHARI network is an informal network that was inspired by the success of the LMMA Network in the Indo - Pacific region. MIHARI aims to facilitate peer - to - peer learning amongst coastal communities, improve communication, raise the profile and expand the use of the LMMA approach and serve as a unified lobbying platform for the interests of Madagascar’s traditional fishers. The creation of MIHARI represents a significant development towards uniting community - led approaches to conservation in Madagascar and highlights the significant role LMMAs can play in marine conservation on a national scale. This is of particular significance in Madagascar, a country with little capacity or financial resources to oversee large - scale marine conservation efforts, a problem compounded by both the vast coastline and geographical isolation of many fishing communities. Madagascar’s new LMMA network is leading the way for coastal community conservation in the western Indian Ocean and aims to serve as the basis for a wider regional LMMA network.},

	abstract = {Management of highly migratory ﬁsh species is generally assumed to require complicated international agreements. The effects of spatial closures for such species are thought to be diluted by their extensive movements. We tested these assumptions using a case study of striped marlin (Kajikia audax) ﬁsheries off of Baja California, Mexico. Beginning in 1977, Mexico instituted a series of long-line ﬁshery closures and closed areas to reduce commercial ﬁshing mortality rates on billﬁshes. Using data from the Japanese long-line ﬁshery and the recreational billﬁsh ﬁshery in a stock reduction analysis (SRA) model, we show that temporary closures of Mexico’s EEZ to long-lining from 1977–1980 and 1984–1985 had a rapid effect on local abundance of striped marlin. Regional striped marlin abundance likely increased by 12–22\% following the 4-year closure and 6–12\% following the 2-year closure. Increases near Baja California may have been larger. Recreational catch-and-release appears to have a more modest effect because catches in the recreational ﬁshery are substantially smaller than historic long-line catches. A 100\% release rate over the 10-year period for which recreational catch data were available would likely have increased regional abundance by 2.8–7.5\% relative to no recreational release. There is also evidence for a small effect of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on recruitment or net immigration, with stronger recruitment or net immigration during the cooler La Niña phase.},

We mapped the social network used for communication of knowledge and information related to natural resource extraction among villagers in a coastal seascape in Kenya. We further identified subgroups and examined their interrelations while measuring to what extent personal attributes such as occupation can explain observed group structure. Finally, we compared the local ecological knowledge held by villagers of different occupations with the structure of the communication network to map how well this structure can explain distribution of ecological knowledge among them. Results show that communication occurs primarily between fishermen who use the same gear type, which may inhibit exchange of ecological knowledge within the community. This may partly explain why the community has been unsuccessful in regulating resource extraction, especially since potentially influential groups of nonfishermen have a limited communication with the various fisher groups. Analysis of network structure also shows that groups most central, and hence potentially most influential, are dominated in numbers by migrant deep sea fishermen, hypothetically less motivated to initiate collective action for resource management. Hence, we conclude that a lack of collective action to remedy an unsustainable situation may be attributed to various different but distinct aspects of the specific structure of the social network.},

It has even been shown that social networks can be more important than the existence of formal institutions for effective enforcement and compliance with environmental regulations. However, all social networks are not created equal. On the contrary, the structural pattern of relations (i.e. the topology) of a social network can have signiﬁcant impact on how actors actually behave. This clearly has implications for actors’ abilities to manage environmental challenges. This review aims to add more precision to initial insights and pending hypotheses about the positive impacts of social networks on governance processes and outcomes, by reviewing and synthesizing empirically based literature explicitly studying structural characteristics of social networks in natural resource governance settings. It is shown that signiﬁcant differences in governance processes and outcomes can be expected among networks experiencing structural differences in terms of density of relations, degree of cohesiveness, subgroup interconnectivity, and degree of network centralization. Furthermore, the review shows that none of these structural characteristics present a monotonically increasing positive effect on processes of importance for resource governance, and that favoring one characteristic likely occurs at the expense of another. Thus, assessing the most favorable level and mix of different network characteristics, where most of the positive governance effects are obtained while undesired effects are minimized, presents a key research and governance challenge.},

This principle—the homophily principle—structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve.},

This is especially true in aquatic environments where shifts in spatial ecology (which are a result of movements) are among the ﬁrst adaptive responses of animals to changes in ecosystems. Changes in the movement and distribution of individuals will in turn alter population dynamics and ecosystem structure. Thus, understanding the drivers and impacts of variation in animal movements over time is critical to conservation and spatial planning. Here, we identify key challenges that impede aquatic animal movement science from informing management and conservation, and propose strategies for overcoming them. Challenges include: (1) Insufﬁcient communication between terrestrial and aquatic movement scientists that could be increased through cross-pollination of analytical tools and development of new tools and outputs; (2) Incomplete coverage in many studies of animal space use (e.g., entire life span not considered); (3) Insufﬁcient data archiving and availability; (4) Barriers to incorporating movement data into decision-making processes; and (5) Limited understanding of the value of movement data for management and conservation. We argue that the ﬁeld of movement ecology is at present an under-tapped resource for aquatic decision-makers, but is poised to play a critical role in future management approaches and policy development.},

We present a case study using the giant sea bass (Stereolepis gigas, Polyprionidae) to highlight how these management and research asymmetries can skew national perceptions of population status for a fully transboundary species. Scientific publications and annual funding related to giant sea bass are 7x and 25x higher in the USA, respectively, despite the fact that 73\% of the species’ range occurs in Mexico. Conversely, annual fishery production and consumptive value of giant sea bass in Mexico are 19x and 3.5x higher than in the USA, respectively, while the non-­ consumptive value related to dive ecotourism is 76x higher in the USA. These asymmetries have generated a distorted view of the population status of the giant sea bass across its entire range.

            Complex social-ecological interactions underpin many environmental problems. To help capture this complexity, we advance an interdisciplinary network modeling framework to identify important relationships between people and nature that can influence environmental conditions. Drawing on comprehensive social and ecological data from five coral reef fishing communities in Kenya; including interviews with 648 fishers, underwater visual census data of reef ecosystem condition, and time-series landings data; we show that positive ecological conditions are associated with ‘social-ecological network closure’ – i.e., fully linked and thus closed network structures between social actors and ecological resources. Our results suggest that when fishers facing common dilemmas form cooperative communication ties with direct resource competitors, they may achieve positive gains in reef fish biomass and functional richness. Our work provides key empirical insight to a growing body of research on social-ecological alignment, and helps to advance an integrative framework that can be applied empirically in different social-ecological contexts.},

We ﬁnd that the social network predisposes cross-scale collaboration for invasive animal control, an action where coordination of activities is necessary. We ﬁnd that for revegetation activities there is little evidence of collaboration across scales, but this could be fostered by a subset of stakeholders acting in a “scale-bridging” role. Addressing this will likely improve the effectiveness of revegetation efforts and the outcomes of the broader conservation initiative.},

	abstract = {How to create and adjust governing institutions so that they align (fit) with complex ecosystem processes and structures across scales is an issue of increasing concern in conservation. It is argued that lack of such social-ecological fit makes governance and conservation difficult, yet progress in explicitly defining and rigorously testing what constitutes a good fit has been limited. We used a novel modeling approach and data from case studies of fishery and forest conservation to empirically test presumed relationships between conservation outcomes and certain patterns of alignment of social-ecological interdependences. Our approach made it possible to analyze conservation outcome on a systems level while also providing information on how individual actors are positioned in the complex web of social-ecological interdependencies. We found that when actors who shared resources were also socially linked, conservation at the level of the whole socialecological system was positively affected. When the scales at which individual actors used resources and the scale at which ecological resources were interconnected to other ecological resources were aligned through tightened feedback loops, conservation outcome was better than when they were not aligned. The analysis of individual actors’ positions in the web of social-ecological interdependencies was helpful in understanding why a system has a certain level of social-ecological fit. Results of analysis of positions showed that different actors contributed in very different ways to achieve a certain fit and revealed some underlying difference between the actors, for example in terms of actors’ varying rights to access and use different ecological resources.},

	abstract = {As industrial vessels continue to expand in both extractive capacity and spatial range, concerns have grown over foreign industrial fishing occurring within the marine territories of developing countries, both legally and ille­ gally. Madagascar’s status as a “least developed country”, coupled with its high marine biodiversity, makes its waters particularly susceptible to fishing by distant water fishing nations (DWFNs). However, given constraints in management and research, it is unclear how foreign industrial fishing, both legal via foreign agreements and illegal, may impact local marine resources that many coastal communities depend on for food security, cultural meaning and livelihoods. We used satellite-derived fishing effort data from 2012 to 2020, via Global Fishing Watch, to analyze industrial fishing effort occurring within Madagascar’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). We documented 907,643 h of industrial fishing within the Madagascar EEZ across 277 vessels from 17 different countries. We found that Taiwanease vessels (39.8\%) using drifting longlines and Malagasy (17.2\% shrimp trawlers were the most prevalent. Fishing effort was highly seasonal (68\% of effort between October and February) and increased with higher global fish prices and the Indian Ocean Dipole, which is a measure of regional water temperature cycles. We also found a number of instances (17.6\% of the fishing effort for 170,726 total hours) of foreign fishing vessels operating close to shore and within a number of marine protected areas. These results highlight the need for increased transparency surrounding foreign fishing agreements and unau­ thorized fishing within the waters of developing countries. Increases in industrial fishing effort and encroach­ ment into near-shore areas has the potential to severely threaten current sustainable fisheries management initiatives by conservation organizations and coastal communities.},

	abstract = {Despite their contribution to employment, food security, poverty eradication, and community well-being, small-scale fisheries often find themselves in a disadvantageous position globally relative to large-scale fisheries and other industries competing for marine space, resources, and government attention. By and large, small-scale fisheries are marginalized in every sense of the word: culturally, socially, economically, geographically, legally, and politically. Their unfavorable status is frequently perceived to be both a cause and effect of overfishing, unsustainable fishing practices, and governance failure; thus, their potential to modernize while participating in and delivering on sustainable development goals is less than optimal. Given that the majority of the world’s fisheries are small-scale, it is imperative that major changes take place in the conditions that determine the predicament of small-scale fisheries. For these reasons, in 2014, FAO member states endorsed the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication (SSF Guidelines), with the aim of encouraging states and civil society organizations to take steps to bring about the changes needed to improve the sustainability and viability of small-scale fisheries. The SSF Guidelines call for broad and complex governance interventions; however, as much as they can help create transformation within small-scale fisheries, governance systems themselves must also be transformed before real change can take place. Based on the analysis of 34 case studies of small-scale fisheries’ governance around the world, our synthesis reveals that small-scale fisheries’ governance is indeed undergoing different types of transformation and can take place in all governing modes. Further, these transformations occur at the operational, institutional, and the meta-levels of governance, which, from the perspective of the SSF Guidelines, is encouraging.},

The observed and anticipated changes in global climate present signiﬁcant opportunities and challenges for societies and economies. We compare the vulnerability of 132 national economies to potential climate change impacts on their capture ﬁsheries using an indicator-based approach. Countries in Central and Western Africa (e.g. Malawi, Guinea, Senegal, and Uganda), Peru and Colombia in north-western South America, and four tropical Asian countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan, and Yemen) were identiﬁed as most vulnerable. This vulnerability was due to the combined effect of predicted warming, the relative importance of ﬁsheries to national economies and diets, and limited societal capacity to adapt to potential impacts and opportunities. Many vulnerable countries were also among the world’s least developed countries whose inhabitants are among the world’s poorest and twice as reliant on ﬁsh, which provides 27\% of dietary protein compared to 13\% in less vulnerable countries. These countries also produce 20\% of the world’s ﬁsh exports and are in greatest need of adaptation planning to maintain or enhance the contribution that ﬁsheries can make to poverty reduction. Although the precise impacts and direction of climate-driven change for particular ﬁsh stocks and ﬁsheries are uncertain, our analysis suggests they are likely to lead to either increased economic hardship or missed opportunities for development in countries that depend upon ﬁsheries but lack the capacity to adapt.},

However, the existing literature on small-scale fisheries (SSF) has paid little attention to the way coastal transformations shape conditions for SSF livelihoods communities. This study proposes a new orientation in SSF studies by exploring the assemblage of entangled sociomaterial processes that account for coastal transformations by investigating waterfront transformation in a fishing community in Karnataka, India. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, we conclude that an entanglement of sociomaterial processes produces unequal outcomes among stakeholders that subsequently reinforce the political and economic marginalization of certain groups of waterfront users. Moreover, the investigated context-specific waterfront assemblage intimately connects to the broader context of national fishery policy, urbanization, and tourism, directing the way coastal space can and should be transformed. Such an analysis contributes to the understanding of changing livelihoods in SSF communities.},

This is partly due to insuﬃcient attention on this sector, whose contribution to society is often assumed to be negligible. It also results from SSF being highly diverse, with complex patterns of harvest and post-harvest activities taking place in a wide range of aquatic environments and often in remote areas. Existing ﬁsheries information systems fail to fully capture the characteristics and essence of SSF, resulting in a lack of integrated and up-to-date data, which further marginalizes the sector in policymaking and governance. To help rectify the situation, the Too Big To Ignore project developed the Information System on Small-scale Fisheries (ISSF), a Web-based, open data portal to collect and disseminate knowledge on various aspects of SSF. This paper describes the conception of ISSF and its key features, and presents some results extracted from the analysis of ISSF data, illustrating the importance of such a global database on SSF.},

	abstract = {In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries involve about 90\% of the total number of fishers and generate significant employment for coastal communities. As defined by Indonesian law, these fisheries are exempted from catch reporting which creates a large gap in catch data for estimating stock status and fishing pressure. Indonesian small-scale fishers are scattered across thousands of islands so that monitoring catches is difficult without a systematic approach to ensure long-term benefits. This paper describes the results of work by the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, in partnership with the USAID Sustainable Ecosystems Advanced (SEA) Project, to initiate the development of a fishing logbook system for small-scale fisheries. This initiative addressed challenging issues pertaining to Indonesian institutional arrangements, capabilities of small-scale fisheries and reliability of fishing logbook data. A holistic intervention using the sustainable livelihood approach was used to unpack the complexities and develop strategies of enabling factors to establish a catch monitoring system for Indonesian small-scale fisheries. This initiative shows that a tradeoff between an ideal fishing logbook system versus an applicable model that may compromise logbook data qualities is inevitable. Also, co-management is seen as a suitable for the purposes of establishing a catch reporting system for Indonesian small-scale fisheries. The initial work described herein is seen as an essential steppingstone for improving management of small-scale fisheries in Indonesia.},

	abstract = {Territorial user rights for fisheries are being promoted to enhance the sustainability of small-scale fisheries. Using Chile as a case study, we designed a market-based program aimed at improving fishers’ livelihoods while incentivizing the establishment and enforcement of no-take areas within areas managed with territorial user right regimes. Building on explicit enabling conditions (i.e., high levels of governance, participation, and empowerment), we used a place-based, human-centered approach to design a program that will have the necessary support and buy-in from local fishers to result in landscape-scale biodiversity benefits. Transactional infrastructure must be complex enough to capture the biodiversity benefits being created, but simple enough so that the program can be scaled up and is attractive to potential financiers. Biodiversity benefits created must be commoditized, and desired behavioral changes must be verified within a transactional context. Demand must be generated for fisher-created biodiversity benefits in order to attract financing and to scale the market model. Important design decisions around these 3 components—supply, transactional infrastructure, and demand—must be made based on local social-ecological conditions. Our market model, which is being piloted in Chile, is a flexible foundation on which to base scalable opportunities to operationalize a scheme that incentivizes local, verifiable biodiversity benefits via conservation behaviors by fishers that could likely result in significant marine conservation gains and novel cross-sector alliances.},

	abstract = {Agent-based complex systems are dynamic networks of many interacting agents; examples include ecosystems, financial markets, and cities. The search for general principles underlying the internal organization of such systems often uses bottom-up simulation models such as cellular automata and agent-based models. No general framework for designing, testing, and analyzing bottom-up models has yet been established, but recent advances in ecological modeling have come together in a general strategy we call pattern-oriented modeling. This strategy provides a unifying framework for decoding the internal organization of agent-based complex systems and may lead toward unifying algorithmic theories of the relation between adaptive behavior and system complexity.},

	abstract = {Demand for data-limited stock assessment methods is increasing, and new methods are being developed rapidly. One class of these methods requires only catch time series and, in some cases, information about life history or fishery characteristics, to estimate stock status. These catch-only methods (COMs) range from statistical models trained on data-rich stocks to mechanistic population models that make assumptions about changes in fishing effort. We review 11 COMs, comparing performance through application to data-rich stocks and simulated fisheries. The catch-only methods evaluated here produce imprecise and biased estimates of B/BMSY, especially for stocks that are lightly exploited. They were also generally poor classifiers of stock status. While no method performed best across all stocks, ensembles of multiple COMs generally performed better than individual COMs. We advocate for testing new COMs using this common platform. We also caution that performance in estimating stock status is not sufficient for gauging the usefulness of COMs in managing fisheries. Greater use of management strategy evaluation is needed before COMs can be considered a reliable tool for management.},

	abstract = {Indices of annual growth variation are not routinely incorporated into ﬁsheries stock assessment models, due to a lack of a general framework for deciding when to include these indices, and of a mechanistic understanding about growth drivers. Such incorporation may also not necessarily lead to improved estimation or management performance. We demonstrate a way to incorporate such an index into an assessment model (Stock Synthesis), and use risk analysis to evaluate its management-related advantages and shortcomings. We applied this method to splitnose rockﬁsh (Sebastes diploproa), where a previously developed growth index is highly correlated with decadal-scale climate indices. We ﬁnd that including a similar index in the simulated assessment increases precision and reduces bias of parameter estimates. However, not including an index or including a completely erroneous index led to highly imprecise estimates when growth was strongly climate-driven. Including this growth index when individual growth was actually constant did not lead to poorer estimation performance. The risk analysis approach can be applied to other stocks to evaluate the consequences of including an index of growth variation.},
